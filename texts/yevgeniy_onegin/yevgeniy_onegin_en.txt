Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin
<h1>Eugene Onegin. A Novel in Verse</h1><delimiter>Translated by Stanley Mitchell.
<i>Pétri de vanité il avait encore plus de cette espèce d’orgueil qui fait avouer avec la même indifférence les bonnes comme les mauvaises actions, suite d’un sentiment de supériorité, peut-être imaginaire.</i><delimiter>Tiré d’une lettre particulière
Tired of amusing proud society,<delimiter>Grown fonder of my friends’ regard,<delimiter>I would have wanted with due piety<delimiter>To offer you a pledge, dear bard,<delimiter>More worthy of your soul’s perfection,<delimiter>Full of a holy reverie,<delimiter>Of poetry and clear reflection,<delimiter>Of high thoughts and simplicity;<delimiter>But so be it — let your affection<delimiter>Accept these chapters and their rhymes,<delimiter>Half-comic and half-melancholic,<delimiter>Ideal and down-to-earth bucolic,<delimiter>The careless fruit of leisure times,<delimiter>Of sleepless nights, light inspirations,<delimiter>Of immature and withered years,<delimiter>The intellect’s cold observations,<delimiter>The heart’s impressions marked in tears.
<h1>Chapter I</h1>
<i>And it hurries to live and it hastens to feel.</i><delimiter>Prince Vyazemsky
<h1>I</h1>
My uncle is a man of honour,<delimiter>When in good earnest he fell ill,<delimiter>He won respect by his demeanour<delimiter>And found the role he best could fill.<delimiter>Let others profit by his lesson,<delimiter>But, oh my God, what desolation<delimiter>To tend a sick man day and night<delimiter>And not to venture from his sight!<delimiter>What shameful cunning to be cheerful<delimiter>With someone who is halfway dead,<delimiter>To prop up pillows by his head,<delimiter>To bring him medicine, looking tearful,<delimiter>To sigh — while inwardly you think:<delimiter>When will the devil let him sink?
<h1>II</h1>
Reflecting thus, a youthful scapegrace,<delimiter>By lofty Zeus’s will the heir<delimiter>Of all his kinsfolk, in a post-chaise,<delimiter>Flew headlong through the dusty air.<delimiter>Friends of Ruslan and of Lyudmila<delimiter>Let me acquaint you with this fellow,<delimiter>The hero of my novel, pray,<delimiter>Without preamble or delay:<delimiter>My friend Onegin was begotten<delimiter>By the Neva, where maybe you<delimiter>Originated, reader, too<delimiter>Or where your lustre’s not forgotten:<delimiter>I liked to stroll there formerly,<delimiter>But now the North’s unsafe for me.
<h1>III</h1>
Having retired from noble service,<delimiter>His father lived on borrowed cash,<delimiter>He gave three balls a year, impervious<delimiter>And lost all in a final crash.<delimiter>Eugene was saved by fate’s decision:<delimiter>Madame took on his supervision,<delimiter>Then to Monsieur passed on her trust.<delimiter>The child had charm, though boisterous.<delimiter>Monsieur l’Abbé, a threadbare Frenchman,<delimiter>Made light of everything he taught<delimiter>For fear of getting Eugene fraught;<delimiter>Of stern morality no henchman,<delimiter>He’d mildly check a boyish lark<delimiter>And walked him in the Summer Park.
<h1>IV</h1>
But when young Eugene reached the morrow<delimiter>Of adolescent turbulence,<delimiter>Season of hopes and tender sorrow,<delimiter>Monsieur was straightway driven hence.<delimiter>Behold my Eugene’s liberation:<delimiter>With hair trimmed to the latest fashion,<delimiter>Dressed like a London dandy, he<delimiter>At last saw high society.<delimiter>In French, which he’d by now perfected,<delimiter>He could express himself and write,<delimiter>Dance the mazurka, treading light<delimiter>And bow in manner unaffected.<delimiter>What more? Society opined:<delimiter>Here was a youth with charm and mind.
<h1>V</h1>
We’ve all learned through our education<delimiter>Some few things in some random way;<delimiter>Thank God, then, it’s no tribulation<delimiter>To put our knowledge on display.<delimiter>Onegin was to many people<delimiter>(Who judged him by the strictest scruple)<delimiter>A pedant, yet an able lad.<delimiter>He was by fortune talented<delimiter>At seeming always to be curious,<delimiter>At touching lightly on a thing,<delimiter>At looking wise and listening,<delimiter>When argument became too serious,<delimiter>And, with a sudden epigram,<delimiter>At setting ladies’ smiles aflame.
<h1>VI</h1>
Custom no longer favours Latin:<delimiter>The truth, therefore, was plain enough —<delimiter>That he was able with a smattering<delimiter>To puzzle out an epigraph,<delimiter>To talk of Juvenal or set a<delimiter>Concluding vale to a letter;<delimiter>From the Aeneid a verse or two,<delimiter>Not without fault, he also knew.<delimiter>He did not have the scholar’s temper<delimiter>In dusty chronicles to trace<delimiter>The story of the human race:<delimiter>But anecdotes he did remember<delimiter>Of bygone times, which he’d relay,<delimiter>From Romulus until this day.
<h1>VII</h1>
The lofty passion not possessing,<delimiter>That sacrifices life to rhyme,<delimiter>He could, no matter how we pressed him,<delimiter>Not tell a trochee from an iamb,<delimiter>Homer, Theocritus he rubbished,<delimiter>But Adam Smith instead he relished,<delimiter>And was a great economist.<delimiter>That is, he knew how states subsist,<delimiter>Acquire their wealth, and what they live on<delimiter>And why they can dispense with gold,<delimiter>When, in the land itself they hold<delimiter>The simple product ready given.<delimiter>His father could not understand,<delimiter>And mortgaged, therefore, all his land.
<h1>VIII</h1>
What Eugene knew of in addition<delimiter>I have no leisure to impart,<delimiter>But where he showed true erudition,<delimiter>More than in any other art,<delimiter>What from his early adolescence<delimiter>Had brought him bliss and painful lessons,<delimiter>What all day long would occupy<delimiter>His aching inactivity —<delimiter>This was the art of tender passion,<delimiter>That Ovid sang and paid for dear,<delimiter>Ending his brilliant, wild career<delimiter>In banishment and deportation<delimiter>To far Moldavia’s steppes, where he<delimiter>Pined for his native Italy.

How soon he learned the skill of feigning,<delimiter>Of seeming jealous, hiding hope,<delimiter>Inspiring faith and undermining,<delimiter>Appearing sombre and to mope,<delimiter>Now acting proud and now submissive,<delimiter>By turns attentive and dismissive!<delimiter>How languid, when no word he said,<delimiter>How fiery, when he spoke, instead,<delimiter>In letters of the heart how casual!<delimiter>Loving one thing exclusively,<delimiter>How self-forgetting he could be!<delimiter>How rapid was his look and bashful,<delimiter>Tender and bold, while off and on<delimiter>With an obedient tear it shone.
<h1>XI</h1>
What talent for appearing novel,<delimiter>Causing with feigned despair alarm,<delimiter>Jesting to make the guileless marvel,<delimiter>Flattering to entertain and charm,<delimiter>Pouncing upon a moment’s weakness,<delimiter>Subduing innocence and meekness<delimiter>With passion and intelligence,<delimiter>Expecting certain recompense,<delimiter>Begging, demanding declarations,<delimiter>Eavesdropping on the heart’s first sound,<delimiter>Chasing his love, and, in a bound,<delimiter>Snatching clandestine assignations…<delimiter>And later in tranquillity<delimiter>Giving her lessons privately!
<h1>XII</h1>
How soon he knew how to bedevil<delimiter>The heart of a professed coquette!<delimiter>Or, to annihilate a rival,<delimiter>How bitingly he would beget<delimiter>A train of malice, spite and slander!<delimiter>What snares he’d set to make him founder!<delimiter>But you, blest husbands, you remained<delimiter>His friends and kept him entertained:<delimiter>The cunning spouse, a Faublas pupil,<delimiter>Was eager to become his man,<delimiter>So, too, the wary veteran,<delimiter>And the grand cuckold, without scruple,<delimiter>Forever satisfied with life,<delimiter>His dinner and adoring wife.

Sometimes, when still in bed he drowses,<delimiter>Notelets are brought to greet the day —<delimiter>What? Invitations? Yes, three houses<delimiter>Inviting him to a soirée:<delimiter>A ball here, there a children’s evening,<delimiter>For which will my young scamp be leaving?<delimiter>With which begin? It matters not:<delimiter>He’ll be wherever on the dot.<delimiter>Meanwhile, apparelled for the morning<delimiter>And, donning a broad bolivar,<delimiter>Onegin to the boulevard<delimiter>Drives out and strolls, at leisure swanning,<delimiter>Until Bréguet with watchful chime<delimiter>Rings out that it is dinner time.
<h1>XVI</h1>
It’s dark: into a sleigh he settles.<delimiter>The cry resounds: ‘Away, away’;<delimiter>Upon his beaver collar, petals<delimiter>Of frostdust form a silver spray.<delimiter>Off to Talon’s: he’s sure that therein,<delimiter>Waiting for him, he’ll find Kaverin.<delimiter>He enters: cork to ceiling goes<delimiter>And comet wine spurts forth and flows,<delimiter>Bloody roast beef is there to savour,<delimiter>And truffles, young men’s luxury,<delimiter>The bouquet of French cookery,<delimiter>And Strasbourg pie, that keeps for ever,<delimiter>Between a golden ananas<delimiter>And Limburg cheese’s living mass.
<h1>XVII</h1>
Thirst still replenishes the beakers<delimiter>To down hot cutlets one by one,<delimiter>But Bréguet tells the pleasure seekers<delimiter>Of a new ballet that’s begun.<delimiter>The theatre’s heartless legislator,<delimiter>Fickle adorer and spectator<delimiter>Of actresses, who are the rage,<delimiter>An honoured citizen backstage,<delimiter>Onegin flies off to the theatre,<delimiter>Where liberty’s admirers are<delimiter>Prepared to clap an entrechat,<delimiter>To hiss off Cleopatra, Phaedra,<delimiter>Call for Moëna (in a word,<delimiter>Make sure their voices can be heard).
<h1>XVIII</h1>
Enchanting world! There shone Fonvizin,<delimiter>Bold king of the satiric scene,<delimiter>A friend of liberty and reason,<delimiter>And there shone copycat Knyazhnin.<delimiter>There, Ozerov shared the elation<delimiter>Of public tears and acclamation<delimiter>With young Semyonova; there our<delimiter>Katenin reproduced the power<delimiter>of Corneille’s genius; there the scathing<delimiter>Prince Shakhovskoy delivered his<delimiter>Resounding swarm of comedies;<delimiter>There was Didelot, in glory bathing;<delimiter>There, in the wings that gave me shelter,<delimiter>My youthful days sped helter-skelter.
<h1>XIX</h1>
My goddesses! Where now? Forsaken?<delimiter>Oh hearken to my call, I rue:<delimiter>Are you the same? Have others taken<delimiter>Your place without replacing you?<delimiter>When shall I listen to your chorus,<delimiter>Behold in soul-filled flight before us<delimiter>Russia’s Terpsichore again?<delimiter>Or will my mournful gaze in vain<delimiter>Seek a known face on dreary stages,<delimiter>And, with my disabused lorgnette<delimiter>Upon an alien public set,<delimiter>Indifferent to its latest rages,<delimiter>Shall I in silence yawn and cast<delimiter>My mind back to a bygone past?
<h1>XX</h1>
The house is full; the boxes brilliant;<delimiter>Parterre and stalls — all seethe and roar;<delimiter>Up in the gods they clap, ebullient,<delimiter>And, with a swish, the curtains soar.<delimiter>Semi-ethereal and radiant,<delimiter>To the enchanting bow obedient,<delimiter>Ringed round by nymphs, Istomina<delimiter>Stands still; one foot supporting her,<delimiter>She circles slowly with the other,<delimiter>And lo! a leap, and lo! she flies,<delimiter>Flies off like fluff across the skies,<delimiter>By Aeolus wafted hither thither;<delimiter>Her waist she twists, untwists; her feet<delimiter>Against each other swiftly beat.
<h1>XXI</h1>
Applause all round. Onegin enters,<delimiter>Treading on toes at every stall,<delimiter>Askew, his double eyeglass centres<delimiter>On ladies whom he can’t recall;<delimiter>At boxes, at the tiers he gazes;<delimiter>With all the finery and faces<delimiter>He’s dreadfully dissatisfied;<delimiter>Bows to the men on every side<delimiter>And, in profound abstraction pacing,<delimiter>Looks at the stage, then turns away —<delimiter>And yawns, exclaiming with dismay:<delimiter>‘The whole damn lot there need replacing.<delimiter>I’ve suffered ballets long enough,<delimiter>And even Didelot’s boring stuff.’
<h1>XXII</h1>
Still cupids, devils, snakes keep leaping<delimiter>Across the stage with noisy roars;<delimiter>And weary footmen still are sleeping<delimiter>On furs at the theatre doors;<delimiter>There’s coughing still and stamping, slapping,<delimiter>Blowing of noses, hissing, clapping;<delimiter>Still inside, outside, burning bright,<delimiter>The lamps illuminate the night;<delimiter>And still in harness shivering horses<delimiter>Fidget, while coachmen round a fire,<delimiter>Beating their palms together, tire,<delimiter>Reviling masters with their curses;<delimiter>Already, though, Onegin’s gone<delimiter>To put some new apparel on.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
Shall I attempt to picture truly<delimiter>The secret and secluded den<delimiter>Where fashion’s model pupil duly<delimiter>Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?<delimiter>Whatever trinket-dealing London<delimiter>To satisfy our whims abundant<delimiter>Exports across the Baltic flood,<delimiter>Exchanging it for tallow, wood;<delimiter>Whatever Paris, in its hunger,<delimiter>Having made taste an industry,<delimiter>Invents for our frivolity,<delimiter>For luxury and modish languor —<delimiter>These graced, at eighteen years of age,<delimiter>The study of our youthful sage.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Pipes from Tsargrad, inlaid with amber,<delimiter>Bronzes and china on a stand,<delimiter>Perfumes in crystal vials to pamper<delimiter>The senses of a gentleman;<delimiter>Combs, little files of steel, and scissors,<delimiter>Straight ones and curved, and tiny tweezers,<delimiter>And thirty kinds of brush to clean<delimiter>The nails and teeth, and keep their sheen.<delimiter>Rousseau (I’ll note with your permission)<delimiter>Could not conceive how solemn Grimm<delimiter>Dared clean his nails in front of him,<delimiter>The madcap sage and rhetorician.<delimiter>Champion of rights and liberty,<delimiter>In this case judged wrong-headedly.
<h1>XXV</h1>
One still can be a man of action<delimiter>And mind the beauty of one’s nails:<delimiter>Why fight the age’s predilection?<delimiter>Custom’s a despot and prevails.<delimiter>My Eugene, like Chaadaev, fearful<delimiter>Of jealous censure, was most careful<delimiter>About his dress — a pedant or<delimiter>A dandy, as we said before.<delimiter>At least three hours he spent preparing<delimiter>In front of mirrors in his lair,<delimiter>And, stepping out at last from there,<delimiter>Looked like a giddy Venus wearing<delimiter>A man’s attire, who, thus arrayed,<delimiter>Drives out to join a masquerade.
<h1>XXVI</h1>
Having diverted you concerning<delimiter>The latest taste in toiletry,<delimiter>I could regale the world of learning<delimiter>With his sartorial repertory;<delimiter>An enterprise that’s bold, I know it,<delimiter>Yet, after all, I am a poet:<delimiter>But pantalons, frac and gilet<delimiter>Are still not Russian words today.<delimiter>Indeed, I offer my excuses,<delimiter>Since my poor style, such as it is,<delimiter>Could well forgo the vanities<delimiter>Of foreign words and like abuses,<delimiter>Though I dipped into, formerly,<delimiter>The Academic Dictionary.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
But to continue with our story:<delimiter>We’d better hurry to the ball<delimiter>To which Onegin in his glory<delimiter>Has sped by coach to make his call.<delimiter>Through sleeping streets, past houses darkened<delimiter>Twin carriage lamps pour out a jocund<delimiter>Illumination row on row,<delimiter>Projecting rainbows on the snow;<delimiter>With lampions around it scattered,<delimiter>A splendid house is brightly lit,<delimiter>Past whole-glass windows shadows flit<delimiter>And profiled heads are silhouetted<delimiter>Of ladies, and outlandish men —<delimiter>Fashion’s most recent specimen.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
Behold our hero at the doorway;<delimiter>Past the hall porter like a dart<delimiter>He flies, ascends the marble stairway,<delimiter>Flicking his straying hair apart,<delimiter>Enters. The ballroom’s full to brimming;<delimiter>The music now is tired of dinning;<delimiter>Mazurkas entertain the crowd;<delimiter>The room is packed, the noise is loud;<delimiter>The spurs of Chevalier Gardes jangle,<delimiter>The little feet of ladies fly;<delimiter>Their charming tracks are followed by<delimiter>Glances that fly from every angle,<delimiter>And jealous female whisperings<delimiter>Are deafened by the howling strings.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
In days of revelries and passions<delimiter>I’d go insane about a ball:<delimiter>For billets doux and declarations<delimiter>There’s no securer place at all,<delimiter>Respected husbands! May I offer<delimiter>My service to you lest you suffer;<delimiter>I beg you, note my every word,<delimiter>I want you always on your guard.<delimiter>And you, mammas, pay more attention,<delimiter>Observe your daughters’ etiquette<delimiter>And keep a hold on your lorgnette!<delimiter>Or else… you’ll need God’s intervention!<delimiter>I’m only writing this to show<delimiter>That I stopped sinning long ago.
<h1>XXX</h1>
Alas, much life I have neglected<delimiter>For every pastime thinkable,<delimiter>Yet were my morals not affected,<delimiter>I to this day would love a ball.<delimiter>I love the youthfulness and madness,<delimiter>The crush, the glitter and the gladness,<delimiter>The care with which the women dress;<delimiter>I love their little feet, yet guess<delimiter>You’d be unlikely to discover<delimiter>Three shapely pairs of women’s feet<delimiter>In all of Russia. Long indeed<delimiter>Have two small feet caused me to suffer…<delimiter>Sad, cold, I still recall their smart,<delimiter>And in my sleep they stir my heart.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
To what far desert will you wander,<delimiter>Madman, to overcome their sting?<delimiter>Ah, little, little feet! I wonder<delimiter>Where now you crush the flowers of spring?<delimiter>Born to the softness of the orient,<delimiter>On our sad snows you left no imprint:<delimiter>You loved the sumptuous feel instead<delimiter>Of rugs that yielded to your tread,<delimiter>You lived in luxury, refinement.<delimiter>For you how long ago did I<delimiter>Forget renown and eulogy,<delimiter>My native land and my confinement?<delimiter>The happiness of youth has passed<delimiter>Like your light trace on meadow grass.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
Diana’s breast, the cheeks of Flora,<delimiter>Are charming, friends, I do agree,<delimiter>But somehow what enchant me more are<delimiter>The small feet of Terpsichore.<delimiter>To all who gaze on them magnetic,<delimiter>Of priceless recompense prophetic,<delimiter>Their classic gracefulness inspires<delimiter>A wilful swarming of desires.<delimiter>I love them, dear Elvina, under<delimiter>A lengthy tablecloth or pressed<delimiter>On grass in spring or when they rest<delimiter>In winter on a cast-iron fender,<delimiter>Upon the parquet floors of halls,<delimiter>Beside the sea on granite walls.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
Once by the sea, a storm impending,<delimiter>I recollect my envy of<delimiter>The waves, successively descending,<delimiter>Collapsing at her feet with love.<delimiter>Oh how I wished to join their races<delimiter>And catch her feet in my embraces!<delimiter>No, never did I in the fire<delimiter>Of my ebullient youth desire<delimiter>To kiss with so much pain and hunger<delimiter>A young Armida’s lips or seek<delimiter>The rose upon a flaming cheek<delimiter>Or touch a bosom full of languor;<delimiter>No, never did a passion’s squall<delimiter>So rend and tear apart my soul.
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
Another memory comes, revealing<delimiter>A cherished dream in which I stand<delimiter>Holding a happy stirrup… feeling<delimiter>A tiny foot inside my hand.<delimiter>Imagination seethes, excited,<delimiter>Once more its contact has ignited<delimiter>The blood within my withered heart,<delimiter>Once more I love, once more I smart!…<delimiter>But why should I think it my duty<delimiter>To praise these proud ones with my lyre,<delimiter>Who don’t deserve the passions or<delimiter>The songs engendered by their beauty.<delimiter>Their charming words and glances cheat<delimiter>As surely as… their little feet.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
But my Onegin? Home to bed he<delimiter>Drives sleepily through city streets,<delimiter>While restless Petersburg already<delimiter>Is wakened by the drummer’ beats.<delimiter>The merchant’s up, the hawker’s calling,<delimiter>And to his stand the cabman’s crawling,<delimiter>The Okhta girl, her jug held tight,<delimiter>Crunches the snow in hurried flight.<delimiter>The early-morning noise is cheering,<delimiter>Shutters unlock, in columns high<delimiter>Blue chimney smoke ascends the sky,<delimiter>The baker, punctual German, wearing<delimiter>His cotton cap, already has<delimiter>Opened and shut his vasisdas.
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
But, turning morning into nighttime,<delimiter>Exhausted by the ballroom’s din,<delimiter>The child of luxury and pastime<delimiter>In blissful shade sleeps quietly in.<delimiter>He’ll wake past noon, and till next morning<delimiter>His selfsame life will go on turning<delimiter>In its unchanging, motley way,<delimiter>Tomorrow just like yesterday.<delimiter>And yet how happy was my Eugene —<delimiter>A free man in the bloom of years<delimiter>‘midst splendid conquests and affairs,<delimiter>‘midst daily pleasures to indulge in?<delimiter>Was it in vain that, feasting, he<delimiter>Displayed such health and levity?
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
No: soon a coldness numbed his feeling;<delimiter>The social hubbub left him bored;<delimiter>The fair sex ceased to be appealing,<delimiter>To dominate his every thought.<delimiter>Betrayals no more entertained him,<delimiter>While friends and friendships simply pained him,<delimiter>Since he, not always, it was plain,<delimiter>Could drink a bottle of champagne,<delimiter>To down a Strasbourg pie and beef-steaks,<delimiter>And scatter caustic words of wit,<delimiter>While thinking that his head might split;<delimiter>And he, a fiery rake, his leave takes<delimiter>Of that exhilerating life<delimiter>Of sabre, lead and martial strife.
<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
A malady, whose explanation<delimiter>Is overdue, and similar<delimiter>To English spleen — the Russian version,<delimiter>In short, is what we call khandra —<delimiter>Possessed him bit by bit; not tempted,<delimiter>Thank God, to shoot himself, but, emptied<delimiter>Of all attachment to this life,<delimiter>He, like Childe Harold, would arrive<delimiter>In drawing rooms, dejected, languid;<delimiter>Neither the worldly gossiping,<delimiter>Nor game of boston, then in swing,<delimiter>Immodest sighs or glances candid,<delimiter>Naught touched Onegin to the core<delimiter>He noticed nothing any more.

Capricious ladies of society!<delimiter>You were the first ones he forswore,<delimiter>And, in our years, bon ton, propriety<delimiter>Have, it is true, become a bore;<delimiter>While you may find a dame among them,<delimiter>Elucidating Say and Bentham,<delimiter>Their conversation, all in all,<delimiter>While harmless, is nonsensical;<delimiter>On top of that, they are so gracious,<delimiter>Majestic and intelligent,<delimiter>So full of pious sentiment,<delimiter>So circumspect, precise and precious,<delimiter>So inaccessible to men,<delimiter>The sight of them brings on the spleen.
<h1>XLIII</h1>
And even you, young beauties, gracing<delimiter>The droshkies that career away,<delimiter>Over the city’s pavements racing<delimiter>From late at night to break of day,<delimiter>You, too, he left in equal measure.<delimiter>An apostate from stormy pleasure,<delimiter>He locked himself inside his den,<delimiter>Yawning, he reached out for a pen,<delimiter>He wished to write — but could not manage<delimiter>The pain of persevering toil,<delimiter>Nothing proceeded from his quill,<delimiter>Nor did he join that cocky parish<delimiter>Or guild of which I’ll speak no wrong,<delimiter>Since it’s among them I belong.
<h1>XLIV</h1>
And once more given to inaction,<delimiter>Empty in spirit and alone,<delimiter>He settled down — to the distraction<delimiter>Of making other minds his own;<delimiter>Collecting books, he stacked a shelfful,<delimiter>Read, read, not even one was helpful:<delimiter>Here, there was dullness, there pretence;<delimiter>This one lacked conscience, that one sense;<delimiter>All were by different shackles fettered;<delimiter>And, past times having lost their hold,<delimiter>The new still raved about the old.<delimiter>Like women, books he now deserted,<delimiter>And mourning taffeta he drew<delimiter>Across the bookshelf’s dusty crew.
<h1>XLV</h1>
Disburdened of the world’s opinions,<delimiter>Like him, disdaining vanity,<delimiter>At that time we became companions.<delimiter>I liked his personality,<delimiter>The dreams to which he was addicted,<delimiter>The oddness not to be depicted,<delimiter>The sharp, chilled mind and gloomy bent<delimiter>That rivalled my embitterment.<delimiter>We both had known the play of passions,<delimiter>By life we both had been oppressed;<delimiter>In each the heart had lost its zest;<delimiter>Each waited for the machinations<delimiter>Of men, and blind Fortuna’s gaze,<delimiter>Blighting the morning of our days.
<h1>XLVI</h1>
He who has lived and thought can never<delimiter>Help in his soul despising men,<delimiter>He who has felt will be forever<delimiter>Haunted by days he can’t regain.<delimiter>For him there are no more enchantments,<delimiter>Him does the serpent of remembrance,<delimiter>Him does repentance always gnaw.<delimiter>All this will frequently afford<delimiter>A great delight to conversations.<delimiter>Initially, I was confused<delimiter>By Eugene’s speech, but I grew used<delimiter>To his abrasive disputations,<delimiter>His humour halfway mixed with bile<delimiter>And epigrams in sombre style.
<h1>XLVII</h1>
How often did the summer court us,<delimiter>When skies at night are limpid, bright<delimiter>And when the cheerful, glass-like waters<delimiter>Do not reflect Diana’s light;<delimiter>Recalling former years’ romances,<delimiter>Recalling love that time enhances,<delimiter>With tenderness, with not a care,<delimiter>Alive, at liberty once more,<delimiter>We drank, in mute intoxication,<delimiter>The breath of the indulgent night!<delimiter>Just as a sleepy convict might<delimiter>Be carried from incarceration<delimiter>Into a greenwood, so were we<delimiter>Borne to our youth by reverie.
<h1>XLVIII</h1>
Leaning upon a ledge of granite,<delimiter>His soul full of regrets and woes,<delimiter>Eugene stood pensively (the Poet<delimiter>Himself appears in such a pose).<delimiter>All round was silent, save a sentry<delimiter>Hailing another, or the entry,<delimiter>With sudden clip-clop from afar,<delimiter>Of droshkies in Millionaya.<delimiter>Upon the sleeping river, gliding,<delimiter>Sailed one lone boat with waving oars,<delimiter>Bold song and horn from distant shores<delimiter>Charmed us… but what is more delighting<delimiter>Than on a merry night to hear<delimiter>Toquato’s octaves drawing near!
<h1>XLIX</h1>
O Adriatic waves, o Brenta!<delimiter>Nay, I shall see you and rejoice,<delimiter>With inspiration new I’ll enter<delimiter>And hearken to your magic voice!<delimiter>To grandsons of Apollo sacred,<delimiter>I know it well, to me it’s kindred<delimiter>From Albion’s proud poetry.<delimiter>The nights of golden Italy<delimiter>I’ll spend with a Venetian daughter,<delimiter>Now talkative, now mute; with her<delimiter>In a mysterious gondola<delimiter>Voluptuously through the water<delimiter>My lips will study how to move<delimiter>In Petrarch’s tongue, the tongue of love.
<h1>L</h1>
My hour of freedom, is it coming?<delimiter>I call to it: it’s time, it’s time!<delimiter>Above the sea, forever roaming,<delimiter>I beckon every sail and clime.<delimiter>Mantled by storms, with waves contending,<delimiter>Upon the sea’s free crossway wending,<delimiter>When shall I start my freedom’s flight?<delimiter>Dull shore that gives me no delight,<delimiter>It’s time to leave you for the ocean,<delimiter>That swells beneath a Southern sky,<delimiter>And in my Africa to sigh<delimiter>For sombre Russia, for the portion<delimiter>Of love and suffering I incurred<delimiter>And where I left my heart interred.
<h1>LI</h1>
Onegin was prepared to travel<delimiter>To foreign parts with me, but fate<delimiter>Was soon to part us and unravel<delimiter>Our plans until a future date.<delimiter>His father died upon the instant.<delimiter>Before Onegin an insistent<delimiter>Brigade of creditors appeared,<delimiter>Each wanting something different cleared:<delimiter>Eugene, detesting litigation,<delimiter>Contented with his lot, at once<delimiter>Abandoned his inheritance,<delimiter>In this perceiving no privation,<delimiter>Or was it that he could foretell<delimiter>His ageing uncle’s death as well?
<h1>LII</h1>
Indeed, quite suddenly the steward<delimiter>Reported uncle gravely ill<delimiter>And on his deathbed, looking forward<delimiter>To bidding Eugene a farewell.<delimiter>No sooner had he finished reading<delimiter>This woeful note than to this meeting<delimiter>Upon a post-chaise Eugene sped,<delimiter>And yawned, as he prepared ahead<delimiter>For sighs and boredom and deception<delimiter>For money’ sake (and it was here<delimiter>My novel started its career);<delimiter>But he, instead of this reception,<delimiter>Found uncle on a table laid,<delimiter>Earth’s tribute ready to be paid.
<h1>LIII</h1>
He found the grounds full of attendants;<delimiter>Arriving from all sides to call,<delimiter>Friends, enemies were in attendance,<delimiter>All lovers of a funeral.<delimiter>The dead man buried, feasting followed,<delimiter>The priests and guests imbibed and swallowed,<delimiter>And, gravely, afterwards dispersed<delimiter>As if some business they’d rehearsed.<delimiter>Now our Onegin, country dweller,<delimiter>Of land, wood, water, factory<delimiter>Is master (former enemy<delimiter>Of order and a wasteful fellow),<delimiter>And very glad to change his lot<delimiter>For something new, no matter what.
<h1>LIV</h1>
For two whole days the lonely meadows,<delimiter>The bubbling brook’s tranquillity,<delimiter>The oak wood’s leafy cool and shadows,<delimiter>Appeared to him a novelty;<delimiter>The third day he could no more muster<delimiter>Delight in grove or hill or pasture;<delimiter>Already they put him to sleep;<delimiter>Clearly he saw he could not keep<delimiter>Out boredom in a country setting,<delimiter>Though not a palace, street or ball<delimiter>Or cards or verse were there at all.<delimiter>Khandra was there, on guard and waiting,<delimiter>And dogged him like a faithful wife<delimiter>Or shadow fixed to him for life.
<h1>LV</h1>
But I was born for peaceful pleasures,<delimiter>For country quiet: there I thrive:<delimiter>There sounds the lyre with clearer measures.<delimiter>Creative dreams are more alive.<delimiter>In innocent pursuits I wander,<delimiter>By a deserted lake I ponder<delimiter>And far niente is my law.<delimiter>I wake each morning ready for<delimiter>Sweet comfort and a free existence:<delimiter>I sleep a great deal, little read,<delimiter>To wanton glory pay no heed.<delimiter>Casting my mind into the distance,<delimiter>Did I not spend my happiest days<delimiter>In idleness and shaded ways?
<h1>LVI</h1>
O flowers, country, love, inaction,<delimiter>O fields! I am your devotee!<delimiter>I always note with satisfaction<delimiter>Onegin’s difference from me,<delimiter>Lest somewhere a sarcastic reader<delimiter>Or publisher or such-like breeder<delimiter>Of complicated calumny<delimiter>Discerns my physiognomy<delimiter>And shamelessly repeats the fable<delimiter>That I have crudely versified<delimiter>Myself like Byron, bard of pride,<delimiter>As if we were no longer able<delimiter>To write a poem and discuss<delimiter>A subject not concerning us.
<h1>LVII</h1>
Poets, I’ll note, in this connection<delimiter>Are friends of amorous reverie.<delimiter>It used to be my predilection<delimiter>To dream of objects dear to me;<delimiter>My soul retained their secret image<delimiter>Until the Muse gave them a language:<delimiter>Carefree, I’d sing of my ideal,<delimiter>Maid of the mountains, and of all<delimiter>The captive maids of Salgir’s waters.<delimiter>Now, friends, I hear you put to me,<delimiter>The question not infrequently:<delimiter>For whom among these jealous daughters<delimiter>Sighs most your lyre? To which of these<delimiter>Did you devote its melodies?
<h1>LVIII</h1>
‘Whose gaze, exciting inspiration,<delimiter>Rewarded with caressing eyes<delimiter>Your pensive song and adoration?<delimiter>Whom did your verses idolize?’<delimiter>Friends, not a single one, believe me!<delimiter>Love’s mad alarms will not deceive me,<delimiter>I’ve been through them with little joy.<delimiter>Happy is he who can alloy<delimiter>Them with a fevered rhyme: he doubles<delimiter>The poet’s sacred frenzy, strides<delimiter>In Petrarch’s footsteps, and besides<delimiter>Relieves the heart of all its troubles,<delimiter>And captures glory’s palm to boot;<delimiter>But I, in love, was stupid, mute.

Love passed, the Muse resumed dominion<delimiter>And cleared the darkness from my mind,<delimiter>Free now, I seek again the union<delimiter>Of feelings, thoughts and magic sound.<delimiter>I write, my heart’s no longer pining,<delimiter>My pen no longer wanders, making<delimiter>Sketches of female heads or feet<delimiter>Alongside verses incomplete.<delimiter>Dead ashes cannot be replenished,<delimiter>I’m sad still, but the tears are gone,<delimiter>And soon, soon when the storm is done<delimiter>And in my soul all trace has vanished,<delimiter>Then will I start a poem — oh,<delimiter>In cantos, twenty-five or so.

I have a plan already for it,<delimiter>And how the hero will be known;<delimiter>But for the moment I’ll ignore it,<delimiter>Having completed Chapter One.<delimiter>I’ve scrutinized it all for any<delimiter>Discrepancies — and there are many,<delimiter>But I’ve no wish to change them yet;<delimiter>I’ll pay the censorship my debt;<delimiter>My labour’s fruits I shall deliver<delimiter>To the reviewers to devour;<delimiter>Depart then, newborn work this hour,<delimiter>Off to the banks of Nevsky river<delimiter>And earn for me the prize of fame:<delimiter>Falsification, noise and blame!

<i>O rus!</i><delimiter>Horace<delimiter><i>O Rus’!</i>
<h1>I</h1>
The country place where Eugene suffered<delimiter>Was a delightful little spot;<delimiter>The innocent might there have offered<delimiter>Blessings to heaven for their lot.<delimiter>The manor house stood in seclusion,<delimiter>Screened by a hill from wind’s intrusion,<delimiter>Above a stream. Far off, there stretched<delimiter>Meadows and golden cornfields, patched<delimiter>With dazzling, multi-coloured flowers;<delimiter>Small hamlets could be glimpsed around,<delimiter>Herds wandered through the meadow ground,<delimiter>And, in its thick, entangled bowers<delimiter>A vast, neglected garden nursed<delimiter>Dryads, in pensive mood immersed.
<h1>II</h1>
The noble castle was constructed<delimiter>As castles should be: solid-based,<delimiter>Designed for comfort, unaffected,<delimiter>In sensible and ancient taste,<delimiter>With lofty rooms throughout the dwelling<delimiter>A salon damasked floor to ceiling,<delimiter>Portraits of Tsars upon the walls<delimiter>And stoves with multi-coloured tiles.<delimiter>Today all this is antiquated,<delimiter>I really cannot fathom why;<delimiter>My friend, however, walked right by,<delimiter>Unable to appreciate it,<delimiter>Since he would yawn, indifferent to<delimiter>An old interior or a new.
<h1>III</h1>
Into that very room he settled,<delimiter>Where, forty years, till his demise,<delimiter>With housekeeper the old man battled,<delimiter>Looked through the window, swatted flies.<delimiter>All was quite simple; oaken floorboards,<delimiter>Table, divan of down, two cupboards,<delimiter>And not an ink stain anywhere;<delimiter>He opened up the cupboards there:<delimiter>The first housed an expenses manual,<delimiter>The second rows of fruit liqueurs<delimiter>And eau-de-pomme in jugs and jars<delimiter>Beside an 1808 annual:<delimiter>The old man, by much work perplexed,<delimiter>Consulted not another text.
<h1>IV</h1>
Alone among his acquisitions,<delimiter>Merely to while away the time,<delimiter>At first, our Eugene made provisions<delimiter>To introduce a new regime.<delimiter>A sage in rural isolation,<delimiter>He eased the peasant yoke, replacing<delimiter>The old corvée with light quit-rent;<delimiter>The serf blessed fate for what it sent.<delimiter>But Eugene’s thrifty neighbour, flurried,<delimiter>Sat sulking; in his corner he<delimiter>Envisaged some catastrophe;<delimiter>Another slyly smiled, unworried,<delimiter>But they were all unanimous:<delimiter>Here was a crank most dangerous.
<h1>V</h1>
At first, they all rode up to greet him;<delimiter>But at the back porch every day<delimiter>A stallion from the Don would meet him<delimiter>As soon as on the carriage way<delimiter>Their country carts could be detected,<delimiter>When off he’d gallop, undeflected.<delimiter>Outraged by this behaviour, they<delimiter>Withdrew their friendship straightaway.<delimiter>‘Our neighbour is a boor, as mad as<delimiter>A freemason, a crack-brained ass;<delimiter>Drinks only red wine by the glass;<delimiter>Won’t stoop to kiss the hands of ladies;<delimiter>It’s “yes” and “no”, not “yes, sir”, “no,<delimiter>sir”.’ All agreed this was de trop.
<h1>VI</h1>
A new landowner, at that moment,<delimiter>Had driven down to his estate<delimiter>And offered equal cause for comment<delimiter>And stringent neighbourhood debate.<delimiter>By name Vladimir Lensky, wholly<delimiter>Endowed with Göttingenian soul, he<delimiter>Was handsome, in his youthful prime,<delimiter>A devotee of Kant and rhyme.<delimiter>He brought with him the fruits of learning<delimiter>From mist-enveloped Germany:<delimiter>Those dreams extolling liberty,<delimiter>That fervent spirit, oddly yearning,<delimiter>That language with its ardent flair<delimiter>And curling, shoulder-length black hair.
<h1>VII</h1>
By chill corruption not yet blighted,<delimiter>Not having fallen yet from grace,<delimiter>In friendly greetings he delighted<delimiter>And in a maiden’s sweet embrace.<delimiter>Of heart’s affairs he had no knowledge,<delimiter>Hope nursed his feelings, gave him courage,<delimiter>And worldly noise and glitter still<delimiter>Lent his young mind a novel thrill.<delimiter>With a sweet fancy he would cradle<delimiter>His doubting heart’s uncertainty;<delimiter>For him our life and destiny<delimiter>Appeared as an enticing riddle,<delimiter>To solve which he would rack his mind,<delimiter>Suspecting wonders of mankind.
<h1>VIII</h1>
He thought that he should be united<delimiter>With a congenial soul, that she<delimiter>Would pine, whenever he departed,<delimiter>And keep awaiting him each day;<delimiter>He thought that friends would, in like manner,<delimiter>Don fetters to defend his honour,<delimiter>And that their hands would never spare<delimiter>The vessel of his slanderer;<delimiter>That there were some whom fate had chosen,<delimiter>Blest comrades of humanity;<delimiter>That their immortal family<delimiter>Would in a future time emblazon<delimiter>Us all with overwhelming rays<delimiter>And grace the world with blissful days.
<h1>IX</h1>
Compassion, righteous indignation,<delimiter>Pure love directed to the good,<delimiter>And fame’s sweet pain, inebriation<delimiter>Had stirred from early days his blood.<delimiter>He with his lyre roamed ever further;<delimiter>Beneath the sky of Schiller, Goethe,<delimiter>In sudden flame his soul burst forth,<delimiter>Kindled at their poetic hearth,<delimiter>And, happy one, without degrading<delimiter>The art’s exalted Muses, he<delimiter>Nursed proudly in his poetry<delimiter>Exalted feelings, never fading,<delimiter>Surges of virgin reverie,<delimiter>And charms of grave simplicity.
<h1>X</h1>
He sang of love, to love obedient,<delimiter>His song possessed the clarity<delimiter>Of simple maidens’ thoughts, of infant<delimiter>Slumber and of the moon, when she<delimiter>Shines in the sky’s untroubled spaces,<delimiter>Goddess of sighs and secret places;<delimiter>He sang of parting and despond,<delimiter>Of something and the dim beyond,<delimiter>He sang, too, of romantic roses;<delimiter>He sang of distant lands, those spheres<delimiter>Where he had long shed living tears,<delimiter>Where silently the world reposes;<delimiter>He sang of life’s decaying scene,<delimiter>While he was not yet quite eighteen.
<h1>XI</h1>
Where only Eugene in their desert<delimiter>Could judge his gifts and quality,<delimiter>He had no appetite to hazard<delimiter>His neighbours’ hospitality;<delimiter>He fled their noisy conversations:<delimiter>Their sensible deliberations<delimiter>Regarding haymaking, the wine,<delimiter>The kennels and their kith and kind<delimiter>Were not, of course, lit up with feeling,<delimiter>Poetic fire, perceptive wit,<delimiter>Intelligence, nor with the art<delimiter>That made society appealing;<delimiter>The talk, though, of their spouses dear<delimiter>Was far less meaningful to hear.
<h1>XII</h1>
Lensky, a wealthy youth and handsome,<delimiter>Was looked upon as marriageable;<delimiter>Such in the country was the custom;<delimiter>All daughters were eligible<delimiter>To court their semi-Russian neighbour;<delimiter>When he arrived, the guests would labour<delimiter>At once, by hinting, to deplore<delimiter>The dull life of a bachelor;<delimiter>The samovar’s inviting Lensky.<delimiter>And Dunya pours him out a cup,<delimiter>They whisper to her: ‘Watch, look up!’<delimiter>They bring in a guitar, too, then she<delimiter>Begins to shrill (good God!) and call:<delimiter>Oh come into my golden hall…
<h1>XIII</h1>
But Lensky, not, of course, intending<delimiter>To wear the ties of marriage yet,<delimiter>Looked forward warmly to befriending<delimiter>Onegin, whom he’d newly met.<delimiter>Not ice and flame, not stone and water,<delimiter>Not verse and prose are from each other<delimiter>So different as these men were.<delimiter>At first, since so dissimilar,<delimiter>They found each other dull, ill-suited;<delimiter>Then got to like each other; then<delimiter>Each day met riding. Soon the men<delimiter>Could simply not be separated.<delimiter>Thus (I’m the first one to confess)<delimiter>People are friends from idleness.
<h1>XIV</h1>
But friendship even of this order<delimiter>We cannot boast of. Having fought<delimiter>All prejudices, we consider<delimiter>Ourselves the ones, all others nought.<delimiter>We all aspire to be Napoleons;<delimiter>Two-legged creatures in their millions<delimiter>Are no more than a tool for us,<delimiter>Feelings we find ridiculous.<delimiter>While fairer in his preconceptions<delimiter>Than many, Eugene was inclined<delimiter>In toto to despise mankind,<delimiter>But (as each rule has its exceptions)<delimiter>Some individuals he spared,<delimiter>And feelings, too, by him unshared.
<h1>XV</h1>
He heeded Lensky with indulgence.<delimiter>The poet’s fervent talk and mind,<delimiter>Still hesitant in forming judgements,<delimiter>His look of inspiration blind —<delimiter>All this was novel to Onegin;<delimiter>He tried to stop his lips from making<delimiter>A chilling comment, and he thought:<delimiter>I’d really be a fool to thwart<delimiter>His moment’s bliss with my rejection;<delimiter>His time, without me, will arrive;<delimiter>But for the moment let him thrive,<delimiter>Believing in the world’s perfection;<delimiter>Forgive the fever of the young,<delimiter>Their ardour and their raving tongue.
<h1>XVI</h1>
All things promoted disputations<delimiter>And led them to reflect: they would<delimiter>Discuss the pacts of vanished nations,<delimiter>The fruits of learning, evil, good,<delimiter>And centuries-old prejudices,<delimiter>The secrets of the grave’s abysses,<delimiter>And life and destiny in turn —<delimiter>All these were subjects of concern.<delimiter>The poet, heatedly contending,<delimiter>Recited in a reverie<delimiter>Fragments of Nordic balladry,<delimiter>And Eugene, gently condescending,<delimiter>While little grasping what he heard,<delimiter>Attended to his every word.
<h1>XVII</h1>
More often, though, it was the passions<delimiter>That occupied my anchorites.<delimiter>Free from their stormy depredations,<delimiter>Onegin sighed with some regrets<delimiter>As he recounted their abatement.<delimiter>Happy who tasted their excitement<delimiter>And in the end could leave it, but<delimiter>Happier still who knew it not,<delimiter>Who cooled his love with separation,<delimiter>Hostility with calumny,<delimiter>Who yawned with wife and company,<delimiter>Immune to jealousy’s invasion,<delimiter>And who ensured he did not lose<delimiter>His fortune to a crafty deuce.
<h1>XVIII</h1>
When to the banner we’ve foregathered<delimiter>Of sensible tranquillity,<delimiter>When passion’s flame at last is smothered,<delimiter>And we as an absurdity<delimiter>Consider its caprices, surges,<delimiter>Belated repetitions, urges —<delimiter>Resigned, but not without a tear,<delimiter>We sometimes like to lend an ear<delimiter>To tales of other people’s passions,<delimiter>And hearing them stirs up our heart.<delimiter>Thus an old soldier takes delight<delimiter>In eavesdropping on the confessions<delimiter>Of young, mustachioed blades who strut,<delimiter>While he’s forgotten in his hut.
<h1>XIX</h1>
But flaming youth is quite unable<delimiter>To hide a feeling or a thought<delimiter>And ever is prepared to babble<delimiter>Love, hatred, joy and sorrow out.<delimiter>Himself by passion invalided,<delimiter>With solemn mien Onegin heeded<delimiter>The poet who confessed his heart<delimiter>With love and using all his art;<delimiter>A simple soul, not seeking glory,<delimiter>He laid his trusting conscience bare.<delimiter>Eugene with ease discovered there<delimiter>The poet’s young, romantic story<delimiter>With its abundant feelings that<delimiter>To us have long since been old hat.
<h1>XX</h1>
He loved, ah, as we cannot know it,<delimiter>Today such love’s anomalous,<delimiter>Only the mad soul of a poet<delimiter>Is still condemned to loving thus:<delimiter>Always and everywhere one vision,<delimiter>One customary, single mission,<delimiter>One customary, single grief.<delimiter>Not cooling distance’s relief,<delimiter>Nor lengthy years of separation,<delimiter>Nor hours devoted to the Muse,<delimiter>Nor foreign beauties he could choose,<delimiter>Nor merry noise, nor meditation<delimiter>Had changed in him a soul whose fire<delimiter>Was lit by virginal desire.
<h1>XXI</h1>
Mere boy, by Olga captivated,<delimiter>Not knowing a tormented heart,<delimiter>He witnessed, tenderly elated,<delimiter>Her childish merriments and sport.<delimiter>In leafy shade, by oaks protected,<delimiter>He shared the games that she selected;<delimiter>Their fathers — friends and neighbours, they —<delimiter>Destined the children’s wedding day.<delimiter>Beneath a backwoods porch the maiden,<delimiter>In girlish innocence and grace,<delimiter>Blossomed beneath her parents’ gaze,<delimiter>A lily of the valley, hidden<delimiter>In densest grass, unnoticed by<delimiter>The passing bee or butterfly.
<h1>XXII</h1>
By her the poet first was given<delimiter>His youthful dream of ecstasy,<delimiter>And thoughts about her would enliven<delimiter>His pipe’s first moan of melody.<delimiter>Farewell to golden games, for ever!<delimiter>He took instead to groveland cover,<delimiter>Seclusion, stillness and the night,<delimiter>The stars and heaven’s brightest light,<delimiter>The moon amid her constellation,<delimiter>The moon, to whom when evening nears,<delimiter>We dedicated walks and tears,<delimiter>Our secret sorrow’s consolation…<delimiter>But now we only see in her<delimiter>A substitute for lamplight’s blur.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
Forever modest and submissive,<delimiter>Forever merry as the day,<delimiter>As charming as a lover’s kisses,<delimiter>As artless as the poet’s way,<delimiter>Her eyes as azure as the heaven,<delimiter>Her flaxen curls, her smile so even,<delimiter>Her voice, her slender waist and stance<delimiter>These made up Olga… but just glance<delimiter>At any novel at your leisure,<delimiter>You’ll find her portrait there — it’s sweet,<delimiter>Once I myself found it a treat,<delimiter>But now it bores me beyond measure.<delimiter>Reader, I shall, if you’ll allow,<delimiter>Turn to the elder sister now.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Her elder sister was Tatiana…<delimiter>This is the first time that we grace<delimiter>A tender novel in this manner<delimiter>With such a name, so out of place.<delimiter>What of it? It is pleasing, resonant;<delimiter>I know, of course, that it is redolent<delimiter>Of memories of ancientness<delimiter>Or maids’ rooms! We must all confess:<delimiter>That even in the names we’re given<delimiter>There’s very little taste on show<delimiter>(We will not mention verses now);<delimiter>Enlightenment we don’t believe in,<delimiter>We’ve simply utilized it for<delimiter>Mere affectation — nothing more.
<h1>XXV</h1>
And so then she was called Tatiana.<delimiter>Lacking her sister’s beauty, poise,<delimiter>Her rosy freshness, in no manner<delimiter>Would she attract a person’s gaze.<delimiter>A wayward, silent, sad young maiden,<delimiter>Shy as a doe, in forest hidden,<delimiter>She seemed inside her family<delimiter>A stranger, an anomaly.<delimiter>She could not snuggle up to father<delimiter>Or mother; and herself a child,<delimiter>By children’s games was not beguiled<delimiter>To skip or play, but often, rather,<delimiter>Would at a window silently<delimiter>Sit on her own throughout the day.
<h1>XXVI</h1>
Of contemplative disposition<delimiter>Beginning with her cradle days,<delimiter>She coloured with a dreamy vision<delimiter>The idle flow of rural ways.<delimiter>Her slender fingers knew not needles;<delimiter>Embroidery seemed made of riddles;<delimiter>With silken patterns she was loath<delimiter>To animate a linen cloth.<delimiter>A sign of the desire to govern,<delimiter>The child with her obedient doll<delimiter>Rehearses for the protocol<delimiter>Of etiquette and worldly canon,<delimiter>And to her doll with gravity<delimiter>Imparts mamma’s morality.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
But even in those years Tatiana<delimiter>Possessed no doll nor made pretence<delimiter>To tell it in an adult manner<delimiter>About town fashions and events.<delimiter>And childish escapades were foreign<delimiter>To her: in winter, tales of horror,<delimiter>Told in the darkness of the night,<delimiter>Gave to her heart much more delight.<delimiter>Whenever nurse, obeying Olga,<delimiter>Brought all her little playmates down<delimiter>To play upon the spacious lawn,<delimiter>She found the games of catch too vulgar,<delimiter>The ringing laughs and jollity<delimiter>Were boring to her equally.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
Upon her balcony, preceding<delimiter>The rising of the dawn, she loved<delimiter>To watch the dancing stars receding<delimiter>That on the pale horizon moved,<delimiter>When earth’s fine edge is softly glowing,<delimiter>The wind that heralds morn is blowing,<delimiter>And by degrees the day grows bright.<delimiter>In winter when the shade of night<delimiter>Possesses half the world much longer,<delimiter>And longer, too, the lazy East,<delimiter>In moonlight overcome by mist,<delimiter>Continues to repose in languor,<delimiter>Awakened at her usual time,<delimiter>By candlelight from bed she’d climb.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
Fond early on of reading novels,<delimiter>For which all else she would forgo,<delimiter>She grew enamoured of the marvels<delimiter>Of Richardson and of Rousseau.<delimiter>Her father was a decent fellow,<delimiter>Of the preceding age and mellow,<delimiter>Who saw no harm in books, which he,<delimiter>Not having read at all, would see<delimiter>As empty playthings, unengrossing,<delimiter>And did not care what secret tome<delimiter>Lay until morning, in his home,<delimiter>Beneath his daughter’s pillow dozing.<delimiter>As for his wife, she’d also gone<delimiter>Quite crazy over Richardson.
<h1>XXX</h1>
Her love for him was not connected<delimiter>With having read her Richardson,<delimiter>Nor was it that she had rejected<delimiter>A Lovelace for a Grandison.<delimiter>But in the past Princess Alina,<delimiter>Her Moscow cousin, when she’d seen her,<delimiter>Had talked about these gentlemen.<delimiter>Her husband was her fiance then,<delimiter>A bond to which she’d not consented;<delimiter>She sighed after another one<delimiter>Who, with his heart and mind, had won<delimiter>Her liking more than her intended:<delimiter>This Grandison was smart at cards,<delimiter>A fop and Ensign in the Guards.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
Like him, she dressed to match the fashion<delimiter>In keeping with good taste, well bred;<delimiter>But all at once without discussion<delimiter>The girl was to the altar led.<delimiter>And, to dispel her dreadful sorrow,<delimiter>Her husband wisely left, the morrow,<delimiter>Taking her to his country seat,<delimiter>Where God knows whom she was to meet.<delimiter>At first, she strained and sobbed and ranted,<delimiter>All but divorced her husband, too,<delimiter>Then turned to household matters, grew<delimiter>Acclimatized, became contented.<delimiter>Habit is heaven’s gift to us:<delimiter>A substitute for happiness.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
Habit allayed the grief she suffered,<delimiter>That nothing else could remedy;<delimiter>A thing of note she soon discovered<delimiter>That gave her equanimity:<delimiter>Between domestic work and leisure<delimiter>She ascertained the perfect measure<delimiter>For governing her husband’s life,<delimiter>And then became a proper wife.<delimiter>She drove out to inspect the farmers,<delimiter>She pickled mushrooms, saved and spent,<delimiter>She shaved the conscripts’ foreheads, went<delimiter>On Saturdays to use the bathhouse,<delimiter>Beat servant girls who got her cross —<delimiter>She, not her husband, was the boss.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
Time was, she would have written in a<delimiter>Shy maiden’s album with her blood,<delimiter>Praskov’ya she’d have called Polina<delimiter>And made a song of every word.<delimiter>She’d wear tight stays to suit convention,<delimiter>A Russian N just like a French one<delimiter>She’d learned to utter through her nose;<delimiter>But all this soon came to a close:<delimiter>Stays, album, the Princess Alina,<delimiter>The sentimental verselets, all<delimiter>She now forgot, began to call<delimiter>‘Akul’ka’ formerly ‘Selina’,<delimiter>And finally appeared becapped<delimiter>Inside a quilted housecoat wrapped.
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
But heartily her husband loved her,<delimiter>On her designs he did not frown,<delimiter>In all, he cheerfully believed her,<delimiter>While dining in his dressing-gown;<delimiter>His life rolled on without a hazard;<delimiter>At eventide, sometimes, there gathered<delimiter>A group of kindly neighbours, who,<delimiter>Informally, arrived to rue<delimiter>And tittle-tattle, who confided<delimiter>And chuckled over this and that.<delimiter>Hours passed — time that the tea was set,<delimiter>They summoned Olga to provide it.<delimiter>Then supper came and close of day,<delimiter>And so the guests would drive away.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
Their peaceful lives went on, retaining<delimiter>The customs of antiquity;<delimiter>At Shrovetide they’d be entertaining<delimiter>With Russian pancakes (or bliny);<delimiter>They fasted twice a year for sinning,<delimiter>They loved round swings that sent them spinning,<delimiter>The choral dances, guessing songs.<delimiter>On Trinity, among the throngs<delimiter>Of yawning peasants at thanksgiving,<delimiter>They touchingly shed tears, three drops<delimiter>Upon a bunch of buttercups;<delimiter>They needed kvas like air for living;<delimiter>And at their table guests were served<delimiter>With dishes, as their rank deserved.
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
And thus the two of them grew older<delimiter>Until the grave invited down<delimiter>The husband, squire and erstwhile soldier,<delimiter>And he received a second crown.<delimiter>He died an hour before his dinner,<delimiter>Mourned by the neighbour of the manor,<delimiter>By children and a faithful wife,<delimiter>More candidly than many a life.<delimiter>He was a simple, kindly barin,<delimiter>And there, above his last remains,<delimiter>A solemn monument proclaims:<delimiter>The humble sinner, Dmitry Larin,<delimiter>Slave of the Lord and Brigadier<delimiter>Beneath this stone reposeth here.
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
To his penates now returning,<delimiter>Vladimir Lensky visited<delimiter>His neighbour’s humble gravestone, mourning,<delimiter>With sighs, the ashes of the dead;<delimiter>Long was his heart with grief afflicted,<delimiter>‘Poor Yorick,’ he declared, dejected,<delimiter>‘He used to hold me in his arms.<delimiter>How, in my childhood, oftentimes,<delimiter>I played with his Ochakov medal!<delimiter>He destined Olga for my bride,<delimiter>Shall I be here that day…? he said.’<delimiter>True sadness put him on his mettle,<delimiter>Vladimir straightway felt a call<delimiter>To write a gravestone madrigal.
<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
And there, in tears, he wrote another<delimiter>To mark the patriarchal dust<delimiter>Of both his father and his mother…<delimiter>Alas! each generation must<delimiter>By Providence’s dispensation<delimiter>Rise, ripen, fall, in quick succession,<delimiter>Upon life’s furrows; in its wake<delimiter>Others the selfsame journey take.<delimiter>So, our light-headed tribe, now roaming,<delimiter>Grows up, gets animated, seethes,<delimiter>Sees off its ancestors with wreaths.<delimiter>But our time, too, is coming, coming,<delimiter>And one fine day our grandsons will<delimiter>Bundle us out with equal zeal!
<h1>XXXIX</h1>
Meanwhile, enjoy, friends, till it’s ended,<delimiter>This light existence, every dram!<delimiter>Its nullity I’ve comprehended<delimiter>And little bound to it I am;<delimiter>I’ve shut my eyelids now to phantoms;<delimiter>But distant hopes appear and sometimes<delimiter>Continue to disturb my heart.<delimiter>I’d find it sad now to depart<delimiter>The world without some recognition.<delimiter>Not courting praise, I live and write,<delimiter>But still, it seems, I should delight<delimiter>In glorifying my sad mission,<delimiter>In having just a single sound<delimiter>Recall me, like a friend that’s found.
<h1>XL</h1>
And someone’s heart it will awaken;<delimiter>And this new strophe that I nurse<delimiter>Will not in Lethe drown, forsaken,<delimiter>If destiny preserves my verse.<delimiter>Perhaps some future ignoramus<delimiter>(A flattering hope!), when I am famous,<delimiter>Will point to my illustrious portrait<delimiter>And say: now that man was a poet!<delimiter>I offer you, then, my oblations,<delimiter>Admirer of Aonia’s maids,<delimiter>O you, whose memory never fades<delimiter>And saves my volatile creations,<delimiter>Whose hand, that favours my renown,<delimiter>Will pat the old man’s laurel crown!
<h1>Chapter III</h1>
<i>Elle était fille, elle était amoureuse.</i><delimiter>Malfilâtre

‘Where now? How very like a poet!’<delimiter>‘Onegin, I must go, goodbye.’<delimiter>‘By all means, but (I’d like to know it),<delimiter>Where do you spend your evenings?’ ‘Why,<delimiter>I see the Láirins.’ ‘That’s amazing.<delimiter>Mercy, does it not drive you crazy<delimiter>To murder every evening thus?’<delimiter>‘Not in the least.’ ‘I am nonplussed.<delimiter>From here I picture the occasion:<delimiter>First (listen, am I right?), I see<delimiter>A simple, Russian family,<delimiter>Concern for guests and their provision,<delimiter>Jam, endless chatter with regard<delimiter>To rain and flax and cattle-yard…’
<h1>II</h1>
‘I do not see why that’s so shocking.’<delimiter>‘It’s boring, that is why, dear man.’<delimiter>‘I hate your fashionable mocking;<delimiter>I’m happy with a homely clan,<delimiter>Where I…’ ‘An eclogue’s bound to follow!<delimiter>For God’s sake, that will do, good fellow.<delimiter>But now, you’re off; I’m sorry. Say,<delimiter>Could you devise for me a way<delimiter>Of seeing for myself your Phyllis,<delimiter>The object of your thoughts from far,<delimiter>Your tears, pen, rhymes, etcetera.<delimiter>Present me.’ ‘But you’re joking.’ ‘Promise.’<delimiter>‘I’ll gladly.’ ‘When?’ ‘Why, now’s all right.<delimiter>They will receive us with delight.’
<h1>III</h1>
‘Let’s go, then.’ At their destination<delimiter>They’re met with the formality,<delimiter>The sometimes onerous ministration<delimiter>Of old-world hospitality.<delimiter>The order of the fare’s habitual:<delimiter>Jam in small dishes starts the ritual,<delimiter>Then lingonberry juice is brought<delimiter>And set upon an oil-cloth board.<delimiter>……………………………………
<h1>IV</h1>
Returning home, the two are flying<delimiter>At high speed by the shortest way.<delimiter>Now let us condescend to spying<delimiter>On what our heroes have to say.<delimiter>‘You yawn, Onegin, what’s the matter?’<delimiter>‘A habit, Lensky — all that chatter.’<delimiter>‘But you seem worse.’ ‘The same old thing.<delimiter>But look, the light is vanishing.<delimiter>Faster, Andryushka, hasten, hasten!<delimiter>What silly places all these are!<delimiter>Oh, by the way, your Larina<delimiter>Is simple, but a dear old person;<delimiter>I fear the lingonberry juice<delimiter>May cause my stomach some abuse.
<h1>V</h1>
‘Please tell me which one was Tatiana.’<delimiter>‘Oh, she’s the sister who appeared<delimiter>All sad and silent like Svetlana,<delimiter>And by the window sat and stared.’<delimiter>‘But surely you don’t love the younger?’<delimiter>‘Why not?’ ‘Were I like you a singer,<delimiter>I’d choose the other for my wife.<delimiter>In Olga’s looks there’s no more life<delimiter>Than Van Dyck has in his madonnas:<delimiter>Her countenance is round and fair<delimiter>Just like the daft moon shining there<delimiter>Above the daft horizon on us.’<delimiter>Vladimir answered icily<delimiter>And all the way sat silently.
<h1>VI</h1>
Meanwhile, Onegin’s visitation<delimiter>Had made on all the Larin folk<delimiter>A most significant impression<delimiter>And given neighbours cause for talk.<delimiter>Conjecture followed on conjecture,<delimiter>All started furtively to lecture,<delimiter>To joke, to judge, not without spite<delimiter>And view Tatiana as a bride;<delimiter>Some, going further still, asserted<delimiter>That wedding plans had all been made<delimiter>And simply had to be delayed<delimiter>Till modish rings had been located.<delimiter>And as for Lensky’s wedding, they<delimiter>Had long ago arranged the day.
<h1>VII</h1>
Tatiana listened with vexation<delimiter>To gossip of this kind; but she,<delimiter>With inexplicable elation,<delimiter>Kept thinking of it secretly;<delimiter>And in her heart the thought was live;<delimiter>The time had come, she fell in love.<delimiter>So will a seed that’s fallen in<delimiter>The earth be quickened by the spring.<delimiter>For long had her imagination,<delimiter>Consumed with pain and lassitude,<delimiter>Yearned to assay the fatal food;<delimiter>For long a heartsick enervation<delimiter>Constrained her youthful breast; her soul<delimiter>Waited… for somebody to call,
<h1>VIII</h1>
And was requited… Eyes asunder,<delimiter>She said: ‘It’s he! He’s made his call.’<delimiter>And now, alas, her hot, lone slumber,<delimiter>And every day and night were full<delimiter>Of him; by some enchanted force<delimiter>All objects seemed without a pause<delimiter>To speak of him; how tedious<delimiter>The kind entreaties and the fuss,<delimiter>The watchful looks of worried servants!<delimiter>Enveloped in despondency,<delimiter>She paid no heed to company<delimiter>And cursed their leisurely observance<delimiter>Of custom and the sudden way<delimiter>They would arrive and overstay.
<h1>IX</h1>
Now with what eager concentration<delimiter>She reads delicious novels through,<delimiter>With what enlivened fascination<delimiter>She drinks deception’s honeydew.<delimiter>In fantasy she visualizes<delimiter>The characters that she most prizes:<delimiter>The lover of Julie Wolmar,<delimiter>Malek Adhel and de Linar,<delimiter>And Werther, martyr to his passion,<delimiter>And Grandison the consummate<delimiter>Who dulls us like an opiate —<delimiter>All these in her imagination<delimiter>Were in a unique shape expressed,<delimiter>All in Onegin coalesced.
<h1>X</h1>
The authors that she loves so seize her,<delimiter>She feels herself their heroine,<delimiter>She is Julie, Delphine, Clarissa;<delimiter>Alone, Tatiana roams within<delimiter>The silent woods, armed with a novel<delimiter>In which she seeks and finds some marvel:<delimiter>Her secret glow, her dreamy mood,<delimiter>Her heart’s abounding plenitude;<delimiter>She breathes a sigh and, taking over<delimiter>Another’s grief or ecstasy,<delimiter>Whispers by heart, unconsciously<delimiter>A letter for her hero lover…<delimiter>But he, whatever else he’d done,<delimiter>Was certainly no Grandison.
<h1>XI</h1>
His manner gravely elevated,<delimiter>The fervent author in times gone<delimiter>Showed us a hero dedicated<delimiter>To perfect aims — a paragon.<delimiter>To him, forever persecuted<delimiter>Iniquitously, he committed<delimiter>A tender soul, intelligence<delimiter>And an attractive countenance.<delimiter>Nursing the flame of purest passion,<delimiter>The hero, always rapturous,<delimiter>Was ready for self-sacrifice,<delimiter>And, in the novel’s closing action,<delimiter>Vice was forever beaten down<delimiter>And virtue gained a worthy crown.
<h1>XII</h1>
But nowadays all minds are clouded,<delimiter>A moral brings on somnolence,<delimiter>Vice in the novel, too, is lauded<delimiter>And there has gained pre-eminence.<delimiter>The British Muse’s tales intrude on<delimiter>The slumber of our Russian maiden,<delimiter>And now she’s ready to adore<delimiter>Either the pensive vampire or<delimiter>The vagrant Melmoth, restless, gloomy,<delimiter>The Wandering Jew or the Corsair<delimiter>Or the mysterious Sbogar.<delimiter>Lord Byron’s whim most opportunely<delimiter>Clothed even hopeless egotism<delimiter>In woebegone romanticism.

My friends, this makes no sense, I know it.<delimiter>Perhaps by heavenly decree<delimiter>I shall no longer be a poet,<delimiter>A demon new will enter me;<delimiter>And having scorned the threats of Phoebus,<delimiter>I’ll settle to prosaic labours;<delimiter>A novel of the ancient kind<delimiter>Will occupy my blithe decline.<delimiter>There, not the secret pangs of villainy<delimiter>I shall in grim relief narrate,<delimiter>But simply, friends, to you relate<delimiter>The legends of a Russian family,<delimiter>Love’s charming dreams in former days<delimiter>And ancient Russia’s rural ways.

I shall record the plain orations<delimiter>When fathers or old uncles met,<delimiter>The children’s chosen assignations<delimiter>By ancient limes, by rivulet;<delimiter>The jealous agonies of lovers,<delimiter>Partings, and tears as love recovers;<delimiter>I’ll have them quarrel once again<delimiter>And lead them to the altar then…<delimiter>I shall recall the tender feeling,<delimiter>Love’s aching words upon my tongue,<delimiter>Impassioned speeches made when young<delimiter>And courting a fair mistress, kneeling<delimiter>And uttering an ardent vow<delimiter>From which I’m disaccustomed now.

Tatiana, dear Tatiana, vanquished!<delimiter>Together with you, now I weep;<delimiter>Your fate already you’ve relinquished<delimiter>Into a modish tyrant’s keep.<delimiter>You’ll perish, dear; but till we lose you<delimiter>The dazzling light of hope imbues you:<delimiter>You’ll summon up a sombre bliss,<delimiter>Discover life’s felicities,<delimiter>Imbibe the magic bane of yearning,<delimiter>Daydreams will court your every pace,<delimiter>And you’ll imagine in each place<delimiter>A tryst to which you’re always turning;<delimiter>In front of you and everywhere<delimiter>You’ll see your fateful tempter there.
<h1>XVI</h1>
Tatiana seeks the garden bowers<delimiter>To grieve in, chased by aching love,<delimiter>But soon her lifeless eyes she lowers<delimiter>And loses the desire to rove.<delimiter>Her bosom lifts, her features redden,<delimiter>A sudden flame consumes the maiden,<delimiter>Upon her lips her breath has died,<delimiter>Her ears with sound, her eyes with light<delimiter>Are filled… Night comes, the moon’s patrolling<delimiter>The distant space of heaven’s dome,<delimiter>The nightingale sings in the gloam<delimiter>Of trees, its sonorous accents calling.<delimiter>Tatiana does not go to bed<delimiter>But quietly talks to nurse instead:
<h1>XVII</h1>
‘I can’t sleep here, nurse, it’s so airless!<delimiter>Open the window, sit by me.’<delimiter>‘Why, Tanya, what is it?’ ‘I’m cheerless,<delimiter>Let’s talk of how things used to be.’<delimiter>‘Tanya, what things? Once I was able<delimiter>To keep a store of every fable,<delimiter>Old tales that, true or false, I’d tell<delimiter>Of maidens and of spirits fell;<delimiter>But now my mind’s grown dark and woolly:<delimiter>I can’t recall a thing. Alas,<delimiter>It’s all come to a sorry pass!<delimiter>I am confused’… ‘Nurse, tell me truly<delimiter>About those years, can you recall<delimiter>Whether you were in love at all?’
<h1>XVIII</h1>
‘Tanya, my dear! We never even<delimiter>Knew what love was in my young day;<delimiter>Else mother-in-law would have driven<delimiter>Me out in no uncertain way.’<delimiter>‘How did you marry, then?’ ‘Oh, Tanya,<delimiter>It seemed to be God’s will. My Vanya<delimiter>Was even younger then than me,<delimiter>And I was just thirteen, you see.<delimiter>Two weeks a matchmaker kept coming<delimiter>To all my kinsfolk, finally<delimiter>My father blessed me. Bitterly<delimiter>I wept for fear of what was looming;<delimiter>While they untwined my braid they wept,<delimiter>And chanted while to church I crept.
<h1>XIX</h1>
‘Into an unknown family taken…<delimiter>But you’re not listening now, I fear.’<delimiter>‘Oh nurse, nurse, I’m unhappy, aching,<delimiter>I’ m sad and sick at heart, my dear.<delimiter>I’m on the verge of crying, sobbing!’<delimiter>‘You are not well.’ ‘My heart is throbbing.’<delimiter>‘Save us, O Lord, have mercy, pray!<delimiter>What would you like, you’ve but to say…<delimiter>Let’s sprinkle you with holy water,<delimiter>You’re all aflame’… ‘I’m not unwell:<delimiter>I am… in love, nurse… can’t you tell?’<delimiter>‘May the good Lord protect his daughter!’<delimiter>Her ancient hand raised in the air,<delimiter>She crossed the girl and said a prayer.
<h1>XX</h1>
‘I am in love,’ again she whispered<delimiter>To the old woman mournfully.<delimiter>‘You are unwell,’ her nurse persisted.<delimiter>‘I am in love, go, let me be.’<delimiter>Meanwhile, the moon was radiating<delimiter>A languid light, illuminating<delimiter>Tatiana’s graces, pale with care,<delimiter>Her loosened and unruly hair,<delimiter>Her tears and, there before her sitting,<delimiter>Upon a bench, the ancient dame<delimiter>With kerchiefed head, her feeble frame<delimiter>Into a bodywarmer fitting;<delimiter>And all beneath the tranquil night<delimiter>Dozed in the moon’s inspiring light.
<h1>XXI</h1>
And now Tatiana’s heart was soaring<delimiter>As she looked out and watched the moon…<delimiter>A sudden thought came, overpowering…<delimiter>‘Nurse, leave, I want to be alone.<delimiter>Just let me have a pen, some paper.<delimiter>The table, too. I’ll lie down later.<delimiter>Goodbye.’ And she’s alone at last.<delimiter>All’s quiet. For her the moon has cast<delimiter>Its light. Upon her elbow leaning,<delimiter>She writes, with Eugene on her mind,<delimiter>And in a letter undesigned<delimiter>There breathes a guileless maiden’s yearning.<delimiter>The letter’s ready, folded, who…<delimiter>Tatiana! Is it written to?
<h1>XXII</h1>
I’ve known fair beauties unapproachable,<delimiter>The chaste, the cold, the wintry kind,<delimiter>Implacable and irreproachable,<delimiter>Unfathomable to the mind;<delimiter>I’ve marvelled at their modish manner,<delimiter>Their inborn virtue, sense of honour,<delimiter>And, to be frank, from them I fled,<delimiter>And, terror-stricken, thought I read<delimiter>Above their brows hell’s admonition:<delimiter>Abandon hope for evermore.<delimiter>The joys of loving they forswore,<delimiter>To frighten people was their mission.<delimiter>Perhaps you’ve seen by the Neva<delimiter>Fair ladies who are similar.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
Amidst admirers acquiescent<delimiter>I’ve seen like women in my days,<delimiter>Conceited, haughty and indifferent<delimiter>To sighs of passion or to praise.<delimiter>But what did I, amazed, discover?<delimiter>That they, despite their stern behaviour,<delimiter>Frightening to a timid swain,<delimiter>Could make his love return again,<delimiter>At least by showing some compassion,<delimiter>At least, by a more tender word<delimiter>That they permitted to be heard,<delimiter>And, blinded in his naive fashion,<delimiter>The lover with new energy<delimiter>Once more pursued sweet vanity.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Why blame Tatiana, then? For having<delimiter>Not known in her simplicity<delimiter>Deceit or falsehood and for craving<delimiter>Her chosen dream so fervently?<delimiter>For loving without double-dealing,<delimiter>Obedient to the bent of feeling?<delimiter>For being predisposed to trust,<delimiter>For being by the heavens blest<delimiter>With turbulent imagination,<delimiter>Intelligence, a lively will,<delimiter>A wayward spirit, never still<delimiter>And with a tender heart’s vibration?<delimiter>Will you then not forgive her, when<delimiter>She follows passion’s weathervane?
<h1>XXV</h1>
Coquettes are cool in their decisions.<delimiter>Tatiana loves in earnest, she<delimiter>Gives up herself without conditions<delimiter>Like a small child, defencelessly.<delimiter>Of love she says not: let’s postpone it<delimiter>To raise its value when we own it,<delimiter>To trap it more assuredly;<delimiter>First let us puncture vanity<delimiter>With hope, then introduce confusion<delimiter>To rack the heart, and when we tire,<delimiter>Revive it with a jealous fire;<delimiter>Or else, fatigued by joy’s profusion,<delimiter>The cunning captive day or night<delimiter>May from his prison-house take flight.
<h1>XXVI</h1>
I can foresee another matter:<delimiter>Saving the honour of my land,<delimiter>I must translate Tatiana’s letter,<delimiter>Without a doubt you’ll understand.<delimiter>Russian she knew, but very badly,<delimiter>She did not read our journals, sadly;<delimiter>And in her native tongue she could<delimiter>With difficulty write a word.<delimiter>And so in French she penned this version…<delimiter>What’s to be done? Once more I say<delimiter>A lady’s love up to this day<delimiter>Has not expressed itself in Russian,<delimiter>Up to this day our proud tongue shows<delimiter>It’s still not used to postal prose.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
Some would have women reading Russian,<delimiter>A frightful prospect, if applied;<delimiter>Imagine females in discussion<delimiter>With The Well-Meaner at their side!<delimiter>I turn to you, my poets, teach us;<delimiter>Is it not true: those charming creatures<delimiter>For whom, to expiate your wrongs,<delimiter>You wrote, in secret, verse and songs,<delimiter>To whom you pledged your heart’s affection,<delimiter>Did they not try, with much travail,<delimiter>Our Russian speech, to no avail,<delimiter>Yet using such a sweet inflection<delimiter>That on their lips a foreign tongue<delimiter>Became their native one ere long?
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
The Lord forbid my ever meeting<delimiter>A bonneted scholar at a ball<delimiter>Or seminarist with a greeting<delimiter>As she departs in yellow shawl.<delimiter>Like rosy lips unused to smiling,<delimiter>Russian, I find, is unbeguiling<delimiter>Without grammatical mistakes.<delimiter>Perhaps (my head already aches)<delimiter>A crop of exquisite new creatures<delimiter>Will heed the journals, set up school<delimiter>And make us bow to grammar’s rule:<delimiter>Verse will acquire more useful features;<delimiter>But I… what matters this to me,<delimiter>I shall respect antiquity.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
An incorrect and careless patter,<delimiter>An inexact delivery<delimiter>Will generate a heartfelt flutter<delimiter>Within my breast as formerly.<delimiter>I’ve not the strength to be repenting,<delimiter>Since Gallicisms are as tempting<delimiter>As bygone sins of youth, no worse<delimiter>Than Bogdanovich’s in verse.<delimiter>But stop. It’s time now I translated<delimiter>The letter of my maiden dear,<delimiter>I gave my word, and what? I fear<delimiter>My wish to do so has abated.<delimiter>I know that tender Parny’s ways<delimiter>Are out of fashion nowadays.
<h1>XXX</h1>
Bard of The Feasts and languid sorrow,<delimiter>If you had still remained with me,<delimiter>I would have troubled you, dear fellow,<delimiter>With a request, immodestly:<delimiter>That you transpose the foreign diction<delimiter>Of an impassioned maid’s affliction<delimiter>Into enchanting melodies.<delimiter>Where are you? Come: my rights I raze<delimiter>And, with a bow, place in your keeping…<delimiter>But in a land of mournful stone,<delimiter>His heart forgetting praise, alone,<delimiter>Beneath the Finnish sky escaping,<delimiter>He wanders, and his soul hears not<delimiter>My grief for his unhappy lot.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
Before me is Tatiana’s letter;<delimiter>Religiously, I treasure it,<delimiter>I read it with a secret shudder<delimiter>And cannot get my fill of it.<delimiter>Who could have taught such tender writing,<delimiter>Such words so carelessly delighting,<delimiter>Who taught her that affecting rot,<delimiter>Mad conversation of the heart,<delimiter>A captivating, harmful mixture?<delimiter>I cannot tell. But now you’ll meet<delimiter>My version, feeble, incomplete,<delimiter>Pale copy of a vivid picture,<delimiter>Or as Der Freischütz might be played<delimiter>By girlish pupils, still afraid.
Tatiana’s Letter to Onegin<delimiter>I write to you — what more is needed?<delimiter>What else is there that I could say?<delimiter>It’s in your power, I concede it,<delimiter>To punish my naiveté.<delimiter>But if you’ve even slightly pitied<delimiter>The dismal lot that I endure,<delimiter>You won’t abandon me, I’m sure.<delimiter>At first, I did not want to vex you.<delimiter>Believe me: you’d have never known<delimiter>The shame I’ve suffered all alone,<delimiter>Had I been hopeful to expect you<delimiter>Here in our home, where we could speak,<delimiter>If only seldom, once a week,<delimiter>Enough to listen to your greeting<delimiter>And say a word to you, and then<delimiter>For days and nights to wonder when<delimiter>I could enjoy another meeting.<delimiter>They say, though, you’re unsociable;<delimiter>You treat our world with condescension,<delimiter>And we’re… in no way fashionable,<delimiter>But welcome you without pretension.<delimiter>Why ever did you visit us?<delimiter>Lost in the village where I languish<delimiter>I never would have known you, thus<delimiter>I never would have known this anguish;<delimiter>Time would have taught me to extinguish<delimiter>My naive longings (but who knows?);<delimiter>I would have found a friend for life,<delimiter>Would have become a faithful wife<delimiter>And virtuous mother, if I chose.<delimiter>Another!… No, I’d not have given<delimiter>My heart to anyone on earth!<delimiter>It has been foreordained in heaven…<delimiter>I was marked out for you from birth;<delimiter>My life has been a precondition<delimiter>For our encounter — which I crave;<delimiter>I know you’re sent by God’s provision,<delimiter>And you’re my guardian till the grave…<delimiter>You came in dreams that soon abounded,<delimiter>Even unseen, I treasured you.<delimiter>Your wondrous glances pierced me through,<delimiter>Long in my soul your voice resounded…<delimiter>No, this was not a dream for me!<delimiter>I knew you on your first appearing;<delimiter>All faint and numb, aflame and fearing,<delimiter>I uttered inwardly: it’s he!<delimiter>Wasn’t it you that I was hearing<delimiter>When in the stillness I’d depart<delimiter>To help the poor folk? Weren’t you nearing<delimiter>Each time I prayed in hope of cheering<delimiter>The anguish of my troubled heart?<delimiter>And even at this very second,<delimiter>Wasn’t it you, dear vision, beckoned<delimiter>And slipped through night’s transparency,<delimiter>Inclining gently at my bedhead,<delimiter>You, who with joy and love persuaded<delimiter>And whispered words of hope to me?<delimiter>Who are you: guardian angel, mentor,<delimiter>Or, if not, a perfidious tempter?<delimiter>Resolve my doubts, my wavering,<delimiter>Perhaps my feelings are misguided,<delimiter>An artless soul’s imagining!<delimiter>And something else has been decided…<delimiter>But let that be! My fate is sealed,<delimiter>I place it now in your safekeeping,<delimiter>I beg of you, become my shield,<delimiter>If you were here, you’d see me weeping…<delimiter>Imagine what it’s like for me,<delimiter>Alone, not understood and ailing,<delimiter>I’m frightened that my reason’s failing,<delimiter>That I shall die here silently.<delimiter>I wait for you: you can inspirit<delimiter>My hoping heart with just one glance<delimiter>Or interrupt this heavy trance<delimiter>With censure, which alas I merit!<delimiter>I close! I dread to read this through…<delimiter>I’m faint with shame and fear… However,<delimiter>I boldly put my trust in you,<delimiter>Whose honour is my pledge for ever.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
By turns, Tatiana’s moaning, sighing,<delimiter>The letter trembles in her hand,<delimiter>Upon her fevered tongue lies drying<delimiter>The rosy seal, a paper band.<delimiter>Her head sinks downward to her shoulder,<delimiter>Her light chemise that won’t enfold her<delimiter>Slips to expose her shoulder’s charm…<delimiter>But now the radiance of the calm<delimiter>And moonlit sky grows dim. A valley<delimiter>Is outlined through the mist of dawn,<delimiter>Streams silver; and a shepherd’s horn<delimiter>Wakes villagers to rise and rally.<delimiter>It’s morn, all bustle here and there,<delimiter>But my Tatiana does not care.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
The rising dawn does not affect her;<delimiter>Sitting with lowered head and still,<delimiter>She does not set upon the letter<delimiter>Her monogram and graven seal.<delimiter>But now the door has opened quietly,<delimiter>Grey-haired Filipyevna treads lightly,<delimiter>Carrying tea upon a tray.<delimiter>‘It’s time, my child, to greet the day.<delimiter>But look, my pretty one, you’re ready!<delimiter>Aren’t you my early little bird!<delimiter>Oh, last night I was so afeard!<delimiter>But thank the Lord, you’re well and steady!<delimiter>There’s not a trace of last night’s fret,<delimiter>Your face is now all poppy red.’
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
‘Oh nurse, I need a favour, listen.’<delimiter>‘Of course, dear, I’m at your command.’<delimiter>‘Don’t think.… who knows?… perhaps suspicion…<delimiter>But don’t refuse, please understand.’<delimiter>‘My dear, I vow by the Almighty.’<delimiter>‘Well, send your grandson very quietly —<delimiter>Give him this note for O… for that…<delimiter>Our neighbour… Tell him not to chat<delimiter>To anybody or to dawdle<delimiter>And not to mention me by name…’<delimiter>‘To whom, then?’asked the ancient dame.<delimiter>‘Oh, nowadays my head’s a muddle.<delimiter>Neighbours are many in this part,<delimiter>I cannot think of where to start.’
<h1>XXXV</h1>
‘Oh really, nurse, you are slow-witted!’<delimiter>‘I’m old, I’m very old, my heart,<delimiter>The mind grows dull, you must admit it,<delimiter>But way back I was very smart,<delimiter>And if the master once requested…’<delimiter>‘Oh nurse, nurse, I’m not interested.<delimiter>What you were like then I don’t care,<delimiter>What matters is this letter here:<delimiter>It’s for Onegin.’ ‘Oh the letter.<delimiter>Do not be cross with me, my soul,<delimiter>You know, I make no sense at all.<delimiter>But you look pale again, not better.’<delimiter>‘It’s nothing, nurse, but don’t delay,<delimiter>Please send your grandson on his way.’
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
The day flowed by, there came no letter<delimiter>Nor anything the following day.<delimiter>Since morning dressed, pale as a spectre,<delimiter>Tatiana waits for a reply.<delimiter>Olga’s adorer drove up. ‘Tell us,<delimiter>Where’s your companion?’ came the zealous<delimiter>Inquiry from the châtelaine.<delimiter>‘He has forgotten us, that’s plain.’<delimiter>Tatiana trembled, flushed, uneasy.<delimiter>‘He promised that today he’d come.’<delimiter>Lensky replied to the old dame:<delimiter>‘No doubt the post has kept him busy.’<delimiter>Tatiana cast a downward look,<delimiter>As though she’d heard a harsh rebuke.
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
It darkened: on the table, gleaming,<delimiter>The evening samovar now hissed,<delimiter>On it the Chinese teapot, warming;<delimiter>Light vapour eddied under it.<delimiter>Poured out by Olga’s hand, the steady,<delimiter>Dark flow of fragrant tea already<delimiter>Into the cups ran, in a stream;<delimiter>A household boy served up the cream;<delimiter>Tatiana, though, preferred to linger<delimiter>Before the window, breathing on<delimiter>The frosted panes; and, pensive one,<delimiter>She wrote, with a beguiling finger,<delimiter>In windowpane calligraphy,<delimiter>A monogram: an O and E.
<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
And, meanwhile, still her soul is aching,<delimiter>And tears have filled her languid gaze.<delimiter>A thud of hoofs!… Her blood is shaking.<delimiter>Closer! Into the yard they race.<delimiter>Eugene! Tatiana, lighter than a<delimiter>Shadow, is leaping through the manor,<delimiter>She flies, flies from the porch outside<delimiter>Into the garden, mortified;<delimiter>Without a backward look she scurries<delimiter>Past borders, little bridges, lawn,<delimiter>The lake’s approach, the copse; has torn<delimiter>Down lilac bushes as she hurries;<delimiter>Through flowers to the brook she flies,<delimiter>Where, halting, out of breath, she sighs
<h1>XXXIX</h1>
And falls upon a bench… exclaiming:<delimiter>‘Here’s Eugene! God, how will I cope?<delimiter>What will he think?’ With torment flaming,<delimiter>Her heart retains a dream of hope.<delimiter>She trembles, burns and looks behind her,<delimiter>Wondering if he’ll come to find her;<delimiter>Hears nothing. In the orchard, maids<delimiter>Were picking berries in brigades<delimiter>And singing by decree a merry,<delimiter>Collective song (aimed to prevent<delimiter>A cunning servant girl intent<delimiter>On eating, secretly, a berry<delimiter>Belonging to her lord — a ruse<delimiter>Which landed folk are pleased to use!<delimiter>Song of the Girls<delimiter>Come, you maidens beauteous,<delimiter>Dear companions, near to us,<delimiter>Frolic, if you’re timorous,<delimiter>Have your fling, my darling ones.<delimiter>Let us sing a song we know,<delimiter>One that we all cherish so,<delimiter>Let us lure a fine young lad<delimiter>To our dance as round we go.<delimiter>When we lure this fine young lad,<delimiter>When we see him distantly,<delimiter>Let us scatter, darling ones,<delimiter>Pelt him with our cherries, dears,<delimiter>Cherries bright and raspberries,<delimiter>Currants red we’ll also throw,<delimiter>Do not come and eavesdrop on<delimiter>Songs we cherish secretly,<delimiter>Do not come and spy upon<delimiter>Games we girls play privately.
<h1>XL</h1>
Tatiana hears with scant attention<delimiter>Their ringing voices, while she waits<delimiter>Impatiently until the tension<delimiter>That agitates her heart abates,<delimiter>Until her cheeks desist from burning.<delimiter>But in her breast there’s still the yearning,<delimiter>Nor do her cheeks give up their glow,<delimiter>But ever brighter, brighter grow…<delimiter>So a poor butterfly will flutter<delimiter>And beat an iridescent wing,<delimiter>Caught by a schoolboy, frolicking;<delimiter>So a small winter hare will shudder<delimiter>On seeing in the distant brush<delimiter>A hunter crouched behind a bush.
<h1>XLI</h1>
Tatiana sighed and, though still yearning,<delimiter>Rose from her bench in calmer state:<delimiter>Set off, but just as she was turning<delimiter>Into the avenue, there straight<delimiter>Before her Eugene stood, eyes blazing,<delimiter>Like some forbidding phantom gazing,<delimiter>And she, as if by fire seared,<delimiter>Stayed rooted to the spot, and feared.<delimiter>But to detail the consequences<delimiter>Of this unlooked-for tryst, dear friends,<delimiter>I’ve no more strength. I’ll make amends;<delimiter>Meantime, I need my recompenses<delimiter>For so much talk — an interlude<delimiter>Of strolls and rest, then I’ll conclude.

The less we love a woman, woo her,<delimiter>The more disposed to us she gets,<delimiter>And thus more surely we undo her<delimiter>And catch her in our tempting nets.<delimiter>Time was, when cool debauch was lauded<delimiter>And as the art of love rewarded.<delimiter>Blowing its trumpet far and wide,<delimiter>It fed a loveless appetite.<delimiter>But this grand game, once so paraded<delimiter>In our forefathers’ vaunted day,<delimiter>Is one for ancient apes to play:<delimiter>The fame of Lovelaces has faded<delimiter>As have their famed red heels affixed<delimiter>And their majestic periwigs.

Who is the man not bored by feigning,<delimiter>Repeating things in other ways,<delimiter>In all solemnity maintaining<delimiter>What people think in any case,<delimiter>By hearing all the same objections,<delimiter>By undermining predilections,<delimiter>Such as a girl of mere thirteen<delimiter>Is free from and has always been!<delimiter>Who will not tire of the denials,<delimiter>The threats, the vows, the put-on fear,<delimiter>The notelets of six pages sheer,<delimiter>The gossip, rings, the tears, betrayals,<delimiter>Surveillances by mothers, aunts<delimiter>And husbands with their friendly stance!

My Eugene drew the same conclusions.<delimiter>In his first youth he’d fallen prey<delimiter>To stormy errors and delusions<delimiter>And passion’s unrestricted play.<delimiter>Spoiled by the life he had been granted,<delimiter>By one thing for a while enchanted,<delimiter>Another disenchanting him,<delimiter>Thwarted desire tormenting him,<delimiter>Tormented, too, by quick successes,<delimiter>Hearing amid the noise and lull<delimiter>The timeless mutter of the soul,<delimiter>A yawn with laughter he suppresses:<delimiter>Precisely so, eight years he killed,<delimiter>His prime thus passing, unfulfilled.

Beauties no longer claimed his passion,<delimiter>He wooed them with insouciance;<delimiter>Refusal was a consolation,<delimiter>Betrayal a deliverance.<delimiter>He sought them with no great affection<delimiter>And left them, feeling no connection,<delimiter>Barely recalled their love and spite.<delimiter>Just so a casual guest one night<delimiter>Will visit friends for some distraction;<delimiter>Sits down to whist; concludes the game:<delimiter>He sets off on the journey home,<delimiter>Falling asleep with satisfaction,<delimiter>And, in the morning, does not know<delimiter>Himself that evening where he’ll go.

But, on receiving Tanya’s letter,<delimiter>Onegin was profoundly stirred;<delimiter>The girlish daydreams that beset her<delimiter>Roused thoughts in him he’d long interred;<delimiter>And he recalled the mournful manner<delimiter>And pale complexion of Tatiana;<delimiter>And plunged into a reverie,<delimiter>A sweet and sinless fantasy.<delimiter>Perhaps a glow of old emotion<delimiter>Returned to him in his decline,<delimiter>But he’d no wish to undermine<delimiter>Her trustfulness, her pure devotion.<delimiter>We’ll fly now to the garden where<delimiter>Tatiana met him, in despair.
<h1>XII</h1>
For two long minutes they were quiet,<delimiter>Onegin then approached her, said:<delimiter>‘You wrote to me, do not deny it.<delimiter>The letter that you sent I’ve read.<delimiter>I read a trusting soul’s confession,<delimiter>A pure, effusive declaration;<delimiter>Your openness appeals to me;<delimiter>It roused into activity<delimiter>A heart that long ago turned heartless;<delimiter>But I’ve no wish to praise you; I<delimiter>Shall recompense your candour by<delimiter>My own confession, just as artless;<delimiter>Listen to my avowal now;<delimiter>And to your judgement I shall bow.

‘If I had wanted life restricted<delimiter>To living in domestic bliss;<delimiter>If I, by kindly fate conscripted,<delimiter>Were destined to be father, spouse,<delimiter>If I could ever without stricture<delimiter>Be charmed by a familial picture,<delimiter>I’d doubtless choose no other bride<delimiter>Than you to cherish at my side.<delimiter>I’d say, without poetic glitter,<delimiter>That I had found my past ideal,<delimiter>With you my destiny I’d seal<delimiter>And cleave to you when times were bitter,<delimiter>A pledge of beauty and the good,<delimiter>And would be happy… if I could!

‘But happiness I never aimed for,<delimiter>It is a stranger to my soul;<delimiter>Alas, the virtues you are famed for,<delimiter>I do not merit them at all.<delimiter>Upon my conscience: do believe me,<delimiter>Wedlock would make you want to leave me.<delimiter>Once used to you, I’d cease to love<delimiter>The bride I could not love enough;<delimiter>The tears that surely you’d be shedding<delimiter>Would fail to touch my heart and would<delimiter>Only infuriate my mood.<delimiter>Judge, then, what roses for our wedding<delimiter>Would Hymen pluck, how many more<delimiter>To mark the days we have in store.

‘What in a family’s more depressing<delimiter>Than when a poor wife wastes her tears<delimiter>Over a spouse who keeps her guessing<delimiter>And day and evening disappears;<delimiter>Where this dull man, pleased with his treasure<delimiter>(Yet cursing fate in equal measure),<delimiter>Is always silent, angry, grim<delimiter>And coldly jealous.

‘Our dreams and years we can’t recover,<delimiter>I shall not renovate my soul…<delimiter>I love you like an elder brother<delimiter>And, it may be, more gently still.<delimiter>So, don’t be angry with me, listen:<delimiter>A youthful maid will always hasten<delimiter>From dream to dream, she no more grieves<delimiter>Than when a sapling sheds its leaves,<delimiter>Exchanging them each spring for fresh ones,<delimiter>Heaven no doubt has ruled it so.<delimiter>You’ll fall in love again, I know,<delimiter>But… learn to govern your confessions;<delimiter>Not all, like me, will understand,<delimiter>Naiveté risks a dangerous end.’

Thus Eugene preached.

You will agree with me, my reader,<delimiter>Our friend respected Tanya’s plight<delimiter>And was not tempted to mislead her;<delimiter>His soul showed here in noble light<delimiter>Not for the first time; though ill-wishers<delimiter>Were unreservedly malicious,<delimiter>Finding him wholly dissolute:<delimiter>His enemies, and friends to boot,<delimiter>(Perhaps there’s not so great a difference)<delimiter>Upbraided him that way and this.<delimiter>I fear those friends who seek to please.<delimiter>Oh give me enemies in preference!<delimiter>What friends are these, if friends at all,<delimiter>Whom for good reason I recall!

What then? Oh nothing.

Hm! Hm!

The love you get from tender beauties<delimiter>Is surer than from kin or friend:<delimiter>However turbulent its duties,<delimiter>Your rights are honoured in the end.<delimiter>That’s so.

Whom then to love? Whom to have faith in?<delimiter>Who can there be who won’t betray?<delimiter>Who’ll judge a deed or disputation<delimiter>Obligingly by what we say?<delimiter>Who’ll not bestrew our path with slander?<delimiter>Who’ll cosset us with care and candour?<delimiter>Who’ll look benignly on our vice?<delimiter>Who’ll never bore us with his sighs?<delimiter>Oh, ineffectual phantom seeker,<delimiter>You waste your energy in vain:<delimiter>Love your own self, be your own man,<delimiter>My worthy, venerable reader!<delimiter>A worthwhile object: surely who<delimiter>Could be more lovable than you?

What followed on from the encounter?<delimiter>Alas, it is not hard to guess!<delimiter>Love’s pangs continued to torment her,<delimiter>Continued to inflict distress<delimiter>Upon a young soul craving sadness;<delimiter>No, in her passion near to madness<delimiter>Still more does poor Tatiana burn;<delimiter>Sleep shuns her bed, will not return;<delimiter>Health, bloom of life that sweetly flowers,<delimiter>Smile, virginal repose and peace —<delimiter>All, like an empty echo cease.<delimiter>On Tanya’s youth a darkness lowers;<delimiter>Thus does the shadow of a storm<delimiter>Enshroud a day that’s scarcely born.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Alas, Tatiana’s fading, waning;<delimiter>Grows pale, is wasting, does not speak!<delimiter>There is no joy for her remaining,<delimiter>Nothing to make her soul less bleak.<delimiter>Shaking their heads, the neighbours gather,<delimiter>Whispering gravely to each other:<delimiter>‘It’s high time that we married her!’<delimiter>But that will do. I much prefer<delimiter>To cheer up the imagination<delimiter>With pictures of a happy love,<delimiter>And from this sad one take my leave.<delimiter>I cannot help, though, my compassion;<delimiter>Forgive: I love Tatiana so,<delimiter>It’s hard for me to let her go.

From hour to hour with still more rapture<delimiter>For Olga, young and beautiful,<delimiter>Vladimir to delightful capture<delimiter>Surrendered now with all his soul.<delimiter>He’s constantly beside her, whether<delimiter>In darkness in their room together<delimiter>Or in the garden, arm in arm,<delimiter>Wandering in the morning calm.<delimiter>What then? By love intoxicated,<delimiter>Bewildered by a tender shame,<delimiter>He only dares from time to time,<delimiter>By Olga’s smile invigorated,<delimiter>To play with an unravelled tress<delimiter>Or kiss the border of her dress.
<h1>XXVI</h1>
He sometimes takes and reads out for her<delimiter>An edifying novel on<delimiter>The state of nature, which the author<delimiter>Knows better than Chateaubriand,<delimiter>Meanwhile omitting certain sections<delimiter>(Inanities or pure confections<delimiter>Too dangerous for Olga’s age),<delimiter>And blushes as he turns the page.<delimiter>Sometimes, all company forsaking,<delimiter>They settle to a game of chess<delimiter>And, leaning on a table, guess<delimiter>What move the other may be making,<delimiter>And Lensky with a dreamy look<delimiter>Allows his pawn to take his rook.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
At home or homewards, at all stages<delimiter>He’s with his Olga occupied,<delimiter>Upon an album’s fleeting pages<delimiter>He sketches pictures for his bride —<delimiter>Of rural prospects, small and simple,<delimiter>A gravestone, Aphrodite’s temple,<delimiter>Or draws a dove atop a lyre<delimiter>With pen and wash she might admire;<delimiter>On pages meant for recollections,<delimiter>Beneath the names already signed,<delimiter>He leaves a tender verse behind,<delimiter>Mute monument of his reflections,<delimiter>Of sudden thought the drawn-out trace,<delimiter>Still, after many years, in place.

Of course, you’ve more than once encountered<delimiter>The album of a country miss,<delimiter>Where all her girlfriends will have entered<delimiter>Their messages in every space.<delimiter>With orthographic imprecision,<delimiter>Unmetered verses, by tradition,<delimiter>In shortened or in lengthened line<delimiter>Betoken friendship’s loyal sign.<delimiter>Upon the first leaf you’ll be meeting<delimiter>Qu’écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?<delimiter>And signed with toute à vous, Annette;<delimiter>And on the last you will be reading:<delimiter>Whoever loves you more than I,<delimiter>Let them append here how and why.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
You’ll find here, doubtless, on some pages<delimiter>Two hearts, a torch and tiny flowers;<delimiter>You’re bound to read here all the pledges<delimiter>Of love until the final hours;<delimiter>Some army poet here has scribbled<delimiter>A verselet, villainously ribald.<delimiter>In such an album, I confess,<delimiter>I, too, am glad to pen a verse,<delimiter>Secure in my presupposition<delimiter>That any zealous rot of mine<delimiter>Will merit a regard benign,<delimiter>And not the solemn inquisition<delimiter>Of those, who, with their wicked smile,<delimiter>Appraise my nonsense by its style.
<h1>XXX</h1>
But you, O miscellaneous volumes<delimiter>From every devil’s library,<delimiter>Magnificent, resplendent albums,<delimiter>A voguish rhymester’s calvary,<delimiter>In which Tolstoy with nimble touches<delimiter>Has plied his wonder-working brushes<delimiter>Or Baratynsky lent his lyre,<delimiter>May God consume you with his fire!<delimiter>Whenever, holding her in-quarto,<delimiter>Some brilliant lady comes to me,<delimiter>I shake with animosity,<delimiter>An epigram I’d fain resort to,<delimiter>Already stirring in my soul,<delimiter>But all they want’s a madrigal!
<h1>XXXI</h1>
It is not madrigals that Lensky<delimiter>In Olga’s album writes to please,<delimiter>His pen breathes love, his tender entry<delimiter>Refrains from frosty pleasantries;<delimiter>Olga alone holds his attention,<delimiter>All that concerns her, every mention:<delimiter>And, river-like, his elegies<delimiter>Flow forth aglow with verities.<delimiter>Just so indeed, with like elation,<delimiter>Your heart, Yazykov, finds the room<delimiter>To sing of someone, God knows whom,<delimiter>And when the precious compilation<delimiter>Of all your elegies appears,<delimiter>They’ll show how fate has shaped your years.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
But hush! I hear an awesome critic<delimiter>Cry: ‘Drop your wreath of elegies,<delimiter>So miserable and pathetic,’<delimiter>And to us rhymesters bellow: ‘Cease<delimiter>Your whimpering and endless croaking<delimiter>About those times you keep invoking,<delimiter>Regretting what is past, what’s gone:<delimiter>Enough! Sing us another song!’<delimiter>‘You’re right and you will surely steer us<delimiter>To trumpet, dagger and the mask,<delimiter>And with each one set us the task<delimiter>Of resurrecting dead ideas.<delimiter>Is that not so, friend?’ ‘Not a bit!<delimiter>No, gentlemen, write odes, that’s it,
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
Like those that praised our mighty nation,<delimiter>Like those established long ago…’<delimiter>‘You mean an ode for each occasion?<delimiter>Oh come, friend, does it matter so?<delimiter>Remember in The Other Version<delimiter>The satirist’s animadversion.<delimiter>Or has that versifier’s guile<delimiter>Replaced our rhymesters’ gloomy style?’<delimiter>‘But elegies don’t have a moral,<delimiter>They’re aimless — that’s what makes one weep —<delimiter>Whereas an ode’s majestic sweep<delimiter>Is noble and…’ ‘Here’s cause to quarrel,<delimiter>But I’ll restrain myself before<delimiter>I make two ages go to war.’
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
To fame and freedom dedicated,<delimiter>Vladimir, when his spirits flowed,<delimiter>Could turn out something elevated,<delimiter>But Olga would not read an ode.<delimiter>When tearful poets have been suffered<delimiter>To read their work to a beloved<delimiter>And gaze into her eyes — they say<delimiter>There is no greater prize today.<delimiter>But blest is he with modest passion,<delimiter>Who reads to her for whom he longs,<delimiter>The object of his love and songs —<delimiter>A pleasant, languid belle in fashion!<delimiter>Blest, too… though, maybe, while he reads,<delimiter>She’s occupied with other needs.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
When I want somebody to read to,<delimiter>To match a dream with tuneful phrase,<delimiter>It is my nurse that I pay heed to,<delimiter>Companion of my youthful days,<delimiter>Or, following a boring dinner,<delimiter>A neighbour comes in, whom I corner,<delimiter>Catch at his coat tails suddenly<delimiter>And choke him with a tragedy,<delimiter>Or (here I am no longer jesting),<delimiter>Haunted by rhymes and yearning’s ache,<delimiter>I roam beside my country lake<delimiter>And scare a flock of wild ducks resting:<delimiter>Hearing my strophes’ sweet-toned chants,<delimiter>They fly off from the banks at once.
<h1>XXXVI. XXXVII</h1>
But where’s Onegin? By the way,<delimiter>Brothers! I must entreat your patience:<delimiter>I shall describe without delay<delimiter>His daily life and occupations.<delimiter>A hermit underneath God’s heaven<delimiter>In summer he was up by seven<delimiter>And, lightly clad, would set off till<delimiter>He reached the river by the hill;<delimiter>The singer of Gulnare repeating,<delimiter>Across this Hellespont he swam,<delimiter>Then drank his coffee, while through some<delimiter>Disreputable journal flitting,<delimiter>And dressed…
<h1>XXXVIII. XXXIX</h1>
A book, sound sleep, a fine excursion,<delimiter>The purl of streams, the woodland shade,<delimiter>A fresh, young kiss for his diversion<delimiter>From dark-eyed, fair-complexioned maid,<delimiter>A fiery steed with trusty bridle,<delimiter>A fancy meal at which to idle,<delimiter>A bottle of resplendent wine,<delimiter>Seclusion, quiet — thus, in fine,<delimiter>The life Onegin lived was sainted;<delimiter>And to it he by slow degrees<delimiter>Surrendered, the fair summer days<delimiter>Never, in carefree languor, counted,<delimiter>Forgetting both the town and friends,<delimiter>The boring feasts and latest trends.
<h1>XL</h1>
But summer in our North is merely<delimiter>A Southern winter’s counterfeit,<delimiter>It’s glimpsed and gone: we know this, clearly,<delimiter>Although we won’t acknowledge it.<delimiter>The sky already breathed with autumn,<delimiter>The sun already shone more seldom.<delimiter>The day was getting shorter now,<delimiter>And with a melancholy sough<delimiter>The forest lost its secret awning,<delimiter>Mist settled on the fields, the peace<delimiter>Was broken by the screech of geese<delimiter>Migrating south: already dawning,<delimiter>A dullish season lay in wait;<delimiter>November stood outside the gate.
<h1>XLI</h1>
A chill, dark dawn presages winter;<delimiter>No labour’s heard upon the fields;<delimiter>A wolf and hungry she-wolf enter<delimiter>The road to find out what it yields;<delimiter>Sensing the pair, a road horse, nearing,<delimiter>Snorts — and the traveller goes tearing<delimiter>Uphill, relieved to be alive;<delimiter>No longer does the herdsman drive<delimiter>His cows abroad while night is clinging,<delimiter>No more at noontime does he sound<delimiter>His horn to gather them around;<delimiter>A maiden in her small hut, singing,<delimiter>Spins by the crackling splintwood light,<delimiter>A friend to every winter’s night.
<h1>XLII</h1>
And crackling frost settles already<delimiter>And silvers midst the fields and leas,<delimiter>(You’ve guessed the rhyme to come is ‘petals’,<delimiter>So take it, reader, quickly, please!).<delimiter>The ice-clad river sheds a lustre<delimiter>That fashion’s parquet cannot muster.<delimiter>The merry sound of boys on skates,<delimiter>Cutting the ice, reverberates;<delimiter>A heavy goose steps out with caution,<delimiter>Plants its red feet upon the ice,<delimiter>And plans to swim, but in a trice,<delimiter>Slips and falls over in mid-motion;<delimiter>The first snow flickers gaily round,<delimiter>Falling in stars upon the ground.
<h1>XLIII</h1>
What pastime can you find that’s pleasing<delimiter>Out in the backwoods? Walking? Try.<delimiter>For all the countryside is freezing,<delimiter>The naked flatness tires the eye.<delimiter>A gallop in the bitter prairie?<delimiter>The very mount you ride is wary<delimiter>In case its blunted shoe should catch<delimiter>Against a sudden icy patch.<delimiter>Under your lonely roof take cover,<delimiter>Let Pradt and Scott divert your mind<delimiter>Or check expenses, if inclined,<delimiter>Grumble or drink, somehow or other<delimiter>Evening will pass, the morrow too:<delimiter>With ease you’ll see the winter through.
<h1>XLIV</h1>
Childe Harold to a T, Onegin<delimiter>Lapsed into pensive indolence:<delimiter>Enjoyed a bath with ice on waking,<delimiter>And then, alone in residence,<delimiter>Absorbed in household calculations,<delimiter>Armed with a blunted cue, he stations<delimiter>Himself at billiards, starts to play<delimiter>With just two balls till close of day.<delimiter>The evening comes, the game is ended,<delimiter>The cue’s forgotten in the shade,<delimiter>Before the fire a table’s laid,<delimiter>Onegin waits: here’s Lensky, splendid!<delimiter>A troika of roan horses wheel<delimiter>Into the yard — quick, start the meal!
<h1>XLV</h1>
At once, a Veuve Cliquot or Moët,<delimiter>That most revered and blessed wine,<delimiter>Is brought to table for the poet,<delimiter>In a chilled bottle, as they dine.<delimiter>Like Hippocrene it sparkles, flashes<delimiter>And pours in playful, frothy splashes<delimiter>(A simile for — please invent).<delimiter>It once enraptured me: I spent<delimiter>My last poor penny on its solace.<delimiter>Dear friends, do you remember that?<delimiter>Its magical cascades begat<delimiter>No dearth of silliness and follies,<delimiter>Verses and jokes in endless streams<delimiter>And arguments and cheerful dreams.
<h1>XLVI</h1>
But now its noisy effervescence<delimiter>Betrays my stomach, and instead<delimiter>I much prefer Bordeaux’s quiescence<delimiter>Which spares the stomach and the head.<delimiter>Aї I can no longer savour;<delimiter>Aї is like a woman’s favour,<delimiter>Ravishing, gay, mercurial,<delimiter>Impetuous and trivial…<delimiter>If now Bordeaux is my addiction,<delimiter>It’s as a friend who’s always there<delimiter>To benefit us everywhere,<delimiter>Partaking sorrow and affliction,<delimiter>Sharing the leisure time we spend.<delimiter>Long live Bordeaux, our precious friend!
<h1>XLVII</h1>
The fire is out; ash barely covers<delimiter>The golden coal; a tiny flow<delimiter>Of vapour, just apparent, hovers;<delimiter>The grate exhales the faintest glow.<delimiter>And, up the chimney, pipe smoke rises.<delimiter>Wine in the gleaming glass still fizzes<delimiter>Among the empty dinner plates.<delimiter>An evening gloom accumulates…<delimiter>I like a friendly chat in quiet<delimiter>Over a friendly bowl of wine,<delimiter>Above all at that special time<delimiter>‘Between the wolf and dog’ (though why it<delimiter>Should be so called, I’ve no idea).<delimiter>But our two friends are talking here:
<h1>XLVIII</h1>
‘How are the Larin girls, I wonder,<delimiter>Tatiana, sprightly Olga, tell?’<delimiter>‘Pour me just half a glass or under…<delimiter>Enough, dear chap… the family’s well<delimiter>And all of them send salutations.<delimiter>But Olga, ah, what transformations!<delimiter>Dear fellow, Olga’s in her prime,<delimiter>What shoulders, bosom, soul!… Some time,<delimiter>Let’s visit them, they’ll be delighted;<delimiter>Judge for yourself, my friend, it’s clear:<delimiter>You drop in twice, then disappear<delimiter>And never show a nose. They’re slighted.<delimiter>But I’m a fool… for as I speak,<delimiter>You are invited there next week.’
<h1>XLIX</h1>
‘I?’ ‘Yes. The family’s celebrating<delimiter>Tatiana’s nameday, Saturday.<delimiter>Mother and Olen’ka are waiting:<delimiter>You’ve no good reason to gainsay?’<delimiter>‘But goodness knows what sort of rabble<delimiter>I shall encounter, that’s the trouble…’<delimiter>‘I’m sure nobody will be there,<delimiter>It’s just a family affair.<delimiter>So let us go, do me the favour!’<delimiter>‘Well, yes; let’s hope I’m entertained.’<delimiter>‘You’re kind,’ Vladimir said and drained<delimiter>His glass, a toast to his fair neighbour,<delimiter>Then started talking once again<delimiter>Of Olga — such is love’s refrain!
<h1>L</h1>
Cheerful he was — about to marry.<delimiter>In just a fortnight he’d be wed.<delimiter>The crown sweet love gave him to carry,<delimiter>The mystery of the nuptial bed<delimiter>Awaited Lensky’s exaltations.<delimiter>Hymen’s concerns and tribulations,<delimiter>The chilling train of yawns in store<delimiter>He neither dreamed of nor foresaw.<delimiter>While we whom Hymen will not capture<delimiter>Perceive in home life but a show<delimiter>Of tedious pictures row on row,<delimiter>A Lafontaine account of rapture…<delimiter>Oh, my poor Lensky, he at heart<delimiter>Was born to play this very part.
<h1>LI</h1>
She loved him… or was she deceiving?<delimiter>Why should a happy man suspect?<delimiter>Blest he who’s given to believing,<delimiter>Who sets aside cold intellect,<delimiter>Whose heart, enjoying bliss delightful,<delimiter>Rests like a traveller drunk at nightfall<delimiter>Or (gentler) like a butterfly<delimiter>That settles on a flower near by;<delimiter>But sad is he who lacks illusion,<delimiter>Whose head is steady, never stirred,<delimiter>Who hates each impulse, every word,<delimiter>Foreseeing always their conclusion;<delimiter>Whose heart experience has chilled,<delimiter>Whose urge to reverie is stilled.

<i>Never know these fearful dreams,<delimiter>You, O my Svetlana!</i><delimiter>Zhukovsky
<h1>I</h1>
Winter that year arrived belated,<delimiter>The autumn weather not yet gone,<delimiter>Impatient nature waited, waited,<delimiter>Snow only fell in January, on<delimiter>The third at night-time. Early waking,<delimiter>Tatiana, from her window seeking,<delimiter>Beheld at morn the whitened court,<delimiter>The roof, the fence and flower plot,<delimiter>Delicate patterns on the windows,<delimiter>The trees in winter’s silver frond,<delimiter>Gay magpies gathering beyond,<delimiter>And distant hills that were by winter’s<delimiter>Resplendent carpet softly bound.<delimiter>The scene is bright and white all round.
<h1>II</h1>
Winter!… The peasant, celebrating,<delimiter>Climbs on his sleigh and clears a spot;<delimiter>Sniffing the snow and hesitating,<delimiter>His nag then somehow starts to trot;<delimiter>A daredevil kibitka hurries,<delimiter>Ploughing up fluffy snow in furrows;<delimiter>The driver hurtles with panache<delimiter>In sheepskin coat and crimson sash.<delimiter>An impish household lad who’s chosen<delimiter>To seat a small dog on his sled,<delimiter>And play the part of horse instead,<delimiter>Already has a finger frozen.<delimiter>He finds it fun, the pain he scorns,<delimiter>His mother from her window warns…
<h1>III</h1>
But pictures with this kind of feature<delimiter>Will not appeal to you, I fear,<delimiter>They’re nothing more than lowly nature,<delimiter>You won’t find much refinement here.<delimiter>Warmed by the god of inspiration,<delimiter>One poet, rich in stylization,<delimiter>Has painted early snow for us<delimiter>In every nuance sumptuous;<delimiter>He’ll hold you fast, there’s no denying,<delimiter>Depicting in his fiery lay<delimiter>Secret excursions in a sleigh;<delimiter>But, in the meantime, I’m not trying<delimiter>To fight with either him or you,<delimiter>Whose Finnish Maid I can’t outdo.
<h1>IV</h1>
Tatiana, knowing not the reason,<delimiter>But being Russian to the core,<delimiter>Adored the Russian winter season,<delimiter>The frosty beauty that it wore,<delimiter>Rime in the sun when days were freezing,<delimiter>The sleighs, and, at late dawn, the blazing<delimiter>Resplendence of the rosy snows,<delimiter>And Twelfth Night evenings dark and close.<delimiter>And in her household these occasions<delimiter>Were celebrated as of old,<delimiter>Young ladies heard their fortunes told<delimiter>In servant girls’ prognostications,<delimiter>That promised them a husband from<delimiter>The army with a march and drum.
<h1>V</h1>
Tatiana held to the convictions<delimiter>Of ancient lore, believed in dreams,<delimiter>In guessing cards and the predictions<delimiter>Discernible in moonlight beams.<delimiter>She was disturbed by every portent,<delimiter>All objects held a secret content,<delimiter>Proclaiming something to be guessed,<delimiter>Presentiments constrained her breast.<delimiter>The mincing tomcat, sitting, purring<delimiter>Upon the stove would lift a paw<delimiter>To wash its snout — in this she saw<delimiter>A certain sign that guests were nearing.<delimiter>Seeing the young moon’s countenance<delimiter>Two-horned, upon her left, at once
<h1>VI</h1>
She’d turn quite pale, begin to tremble.<delimiter>Or if a falling star should fly<delimiter>Across the sombre sky and crumble,<delimiter>Then Tanya hurried to be nigh,<delimiter>To catch the star while still in motion<delimiter>And, all her senses in commotion,<delimiter>To whisper to it her desire.<delimiter>If it should anywhere transpire<delimiter>In her excursions from the manor<delimiter>For her to meet a monk in black<delimiter>Or see a swift hare cross her track,<delimiter>All this so terrified Tatiana,<delimiter>That she with sad presentiment<delimiter>Expected some adverse event.
<h1>VII</h1>
And yet — she found a secret pleasure<delimiter>In very terror; surely we<delimiter>Are creatures that you cannot measure,<delimiter>We all are contradictory.<delimiter>Yuletide is come with jubilation;<delimiter>Immersed in blissful divination,<delimiter>The young have nothing to regret,<delimiter>Their life extends before them yet,<delimiter>A radiant prospect, undiscovered;<delimiter>Through spectacles old age divines<delimiter>While to the gravestone it inclines<delimiter>And nothing past can be recovered;<delimiter>But does it matter? They’ll believe<delimiter>Their hopeful prattle till they leave.
<h1>VIII</h1>
With curious gaze Tatiana ponders<delimiter>The wax that, sinking, leaves behind<delimiter>A labyrinthine web of wonders,<delimiter>Enchanting wondrously her mind.<delimiter>Up from a brimming dish of water<delimiter>Rings surface in successive order;<delimiter>And, when her little ring appears,<delimiter>A song is sung of bygone years:<delimiter>The peasants there have all the riches,<delimiter>They heap up silver with their spades;<delimiter>We promise those who hear us maids<delimiter>Glory and good! The tune is piteous,<delimiter>Portending losses and mischance;<delimiter>Maidens prefer the tomcat chants.
<h1>IX</h1>
A frosty night; a sky transparent;<delimiter>A starry choir from heaven flows<delimiter>In so serene and quiet a current…<delimiter>In low-cut frock Tatiana goes<delimiter>Into the spacious courtyard, training<delimiter>A mirror on the moon, complaining<delimiter>That nothing in her darkened glass<delimiter>Shows save the trembling moon, downcast…<delimiter>But hark!… a crunch of snow… the maiden<delimiter>Flies tiptoe to a passing man,<delimiter>Her little voice more tender than<delimiter>The sound of reed pipe gently played on:<delimiter>‘What is your name?’ He looks; anon<delimiter>He answers: it is Agafon.
<h1>X</h1>
Instructed by her nurse, Tatiana<delimiter>Arranged a séance all night through;<delimiter>And in the bathhouse of the manor<delimiter>Ordered a table laid for two.<delimiter>But sudden fear assailed Tatiana…<delimiter>And I — remembering Svetlana —<delimiter>Felt fear as well — but that will do…<delimiter>We won’t tell fortunes all night through.<delimiter>Her silken girdle she unknotted,<delimiter>Undressed and settled into bed,<delimiter>Lel hovering above her head,<delimiter>While underneath her pillow slotted<delimiter>Lies a young maiden’s looking glass.<delimiter>All’s hushed. Sleep overtakes the lass.
<h1>XI</h1>
A wondrous dream she has: she’s taken<delimiter>A path across a snow-filled glade.<delimiter>Gloomy and dismal, sad, forsaken;<delimiter>Snowdrifts rear up before the maid,<delimiter>And through them runs a seething torrent,<delimiter>A dark, untamed and age-old current,<delimiter>With thundering, whirring, churning waves;<delimiter>Glued by the ice, two flimsy staves<delimiter>Are set above the rushing water —<delimiter>A perilous and tiny bridge<delimiter>That oscillates from edge to edge.<delimiter>This and the roaring chasm thwart her;<delimiter>Perplexed, not knowing what to think,<delimiter>She halts there at the very brink.
<h1>XII</h1>
As at a vexing separation,<delimiter>Tatiana murmured at the tide,<delimiter>Saw neither man nor habitation<delimiter>To call to on the other side.<delimiter>But soon a drift began to quiver<delimiter>And who appeared beside the river?<delimiter>A burly bear with ruffled fur;<delimiter>Tatiana cried, he roared at her,<delimiter>Stretched out a paw, sharp claws protruding;<delimiter>She braced herself, with trembling hand<delimiter>She leaned on it and scarce could stand;<delimiter>They reached the bank, where she, concluding<delimiter>That she was safe, walked on ahead,<delimiter>Then… what was that?… a bear-like tread!
<h1>XIII</h1>
The shaggy footman is behind her,<delimiter>She dares not look, strains every limb<delimiter>In hope the creature will not find her,<delimiter>But there is no escaping him.<delimiter>The odious bear comes grunting, lumbering;<delimiter>A wood’s before them; pines are slumbering<delimiter>In frowning beauty, boughs hang low,<delimiter>Weighed down with heavy flocks of snow;<delimiter>And, seeping through the topmost summits<delimiter>Of aspens, birches, lindens bare,<delimiter>The starry rays invade the air.<delimiter>The shrubs, the path and where it plummets<delimiter>Are covered by the blizzard’s sweep<delimiter>And in the snowfall buried deep.
<h1>XIV</h1>
Bear in pursuit, Tatiana dashes<delimiter>Into the wood, up to her knee<delimiter>In powdery snow; a long branch catches<delimiter>Her by the neck, then forcefully<delimiter>Wrenches away her golden earrings;<delimiter>Tatiana, wholly without bearings,<delimiter>Leaves in the snow a small, wet boot,<delimiter>Pulled from her charming little foot;<delimiter>She drops her handkerchief, foregoing<delimiter>To pick it up, the bear is nigh,<delimiter>Her hand is trembling, yet she’s shy<delimiter>To raise the dress around her flowing;<delimiter>She runs, and he pursues her still,<delimiter>Then she abandons strength and will.
<h1>XV</h1>
She falls into the snow; and nimbly<delimiter>The bear retrieves and carries her;<delimiter>She yields insensibly and limply,<delimiter>She does not breathe, she does not stir;<delimiter>Along a forest path he rushes,<delimiter>And suddenly through trees and bushes<delimiter>A hut appears; all’s wild around<delimiter>And sad snow covers roof and ground,<delimiter>A window sheds illumination<delimiter>And noise and shouting blast the ear;<delimiter>The bear declares: ‘My gaffer’s here:<delimiter>It’s warm inside his habitation.’<delimiter>And, quickly, opening the door,<delimiter>He lays the maiden on the floor.
<h1>XVI</h1>
Tatiana, coming to, looks round her:<delimiter>The bear has gone: beyond the hall<delimiter>Shouting and tinkling glass astound her<delimiter>As if there’s some big funeral;<delimiter>Making no sense of this she quietly<delimiter>Peers through a chink… the scene’s unsightly,<delimiter>No fancy could imagine it:<delimiter>Around a table monsters sit,<delimiter>One with a dog’s face, horned, abnormal,<delimiter>Another with a cockerel’s head,<delimiter>A witch with bearded goat cross-bred,<delimiter>A skeleton, august and formal,<delimiter>A small-tailed dwarf, and what is that,<delimiter>Apparently half-crane, half-cat?
<h1>XVII</h1>
More wondrous, more intimidating,<delimiter>Astride a spider sits a crab,<delimiter>Upon a goose’s neck, rotating,<delimiter>A skull is perched with scarlet cap,<delimiter>And there a crouching windmill dances,<delimiter>Waving its snapping vanes like lances;<delimiter>Barks, laughter, whistles, song, applause,<delimiter>Men’s talk and horses stamping floors!<delimiter>What could Tatiana do but marvel<delimiter>To see among this company<delimiter>The man she loved so fearfully,<delimiter>The hero of our present novel!<delimiter>Onegin steals a quick look for<delimiter>Whoever may be at the door.
<h1>XVIII</h1>
He gives a sign — they spring to action,<delimiter>He drinks — they shout and drink a round.<delimiter>He laughs — they roar with satisfaction,<delimiter>He knits his brow — there’s not a sound.<delimiter>It’s obvious that he’s the master:<delimiter>And Tanya no more fears disaster,<delimiter>And curious to find out more<delimiter>She opens gingerly the door…<delimiter>A sudden gust of wind blows, lashing<delimiter>The flaming lamps that light the night;<delimiter>The goblins cower at the sight;<delimiter>Onegin, from his chair, eyes flashing,<delimiter>Rises with clatter; they all rise:<delimiter>And swiftly to the door he flies.
<h1>XIX</h1>
A terrified Tatiana hastens<delimiter>To flee Onegin and his team;<delimiter>Not possible; and, in impatience,<delimiter>She scurries round and wants to scream,<delimiter>But Eugene pulls the door wide open<delimiter>And she’s exposed to the misshapen<delimiter>And hellish spectres; savage cries<delimiter>Of laughter resonate; their eyes,<delimiter>Their curved proboscises, moustaches,<delimiter>Their hooves, horns, tusks and tufted tails,<delimiter>Their bony fingers, sharp like nails,<delimiter>Their bloody tongues — all these mismatches<delimiter>At once towards the girl incline<delimiter>And all cry out: ‘She’s mine! She’s mine!
<h1>XX</h1>
‘She’s mine,’ Onegin spoke out grimly,<delimiter>And suddenly the pack was gone;<delimiter>In frosty darkness Tanya dimly<delimiter>Confronted Eugene all alone.<delimiter>Towards a corner seat he takes her,<delimiter>Upon a shaky bench he lays her<delimiter>And, bending downward, rests his head<delimiter>Upon her shoulder; when a tread<delimiter>Discloses Olga, then Vladimir;<delimiter>A sudden light, and in alarm<delimiter>Onegin stands with upraised arm,<delimiter>His eyes roam wildly seeing him here,<delimiter>He chides the uninvited pair;<delimiter>Tatiana’s lying in despair.
<h1>XXI</h1>
The argument grows louder quickly,<delimiter>Onegin snatches up a knife,<delimiter>Frightening shadows gather thickly,<delimiter>Onegin’s taken Lensky’s life.<delimiter>A piercing cry, the hut is shaking,<delimiter>Tatiana, terror-stricken, waking,<delimiter>Looks round her room, already bright,<delimiter>As through a frozen pane the light<delimiter>Of crimson dawn’s already playing;<delimiter>The door stirs. Olga flies to her,<delimiter>Aurora-like but rosier,<delimiter>And lighter than a swallow, saying:<delimiter>‘What did you dream, whom did you see?<delimiter>Oh, Tanya, tell, who can it be?’
<h1>XXII</h1>
But she, not noticing her sister,<delimiter>Lay leafing through a book in bed;<delimiter>Page after page kept turning faster,<delimiter>And to her sister nothing said.<delimiter>The book that claimed her rapt attention<delimiter>Wanted the poet’s sweet invention,<delimiter>No saws or pictures could be seen,<delimiter>But neither Virgil nor Racine,<delimiter>Not Seneca, not Scott, not Byron,<delimiter>Not even Ladies’ Fashion could<delimiter>Engross so much a woman’s mood:<delimiter>What now enticed her like a siren<delimiter>Was Martin Zadek, Chaldee sage,<delimiter>Who solved your dreams on every page.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
This weighty tome a passing trader<delimiter>Had brought to Tanya’s solitude,<delimiter>And finally managed to persuade her<delimiter>To buy it, if he could include<delimiter>A few odd volumes of Malvina;<delimiter>She paid three rubles, one poltina,<delimiter>He also put into the scales<delimiter>A book containing vulgar tales,<delimiter>Two Petriads, a Russian grammar<delimiter>And volume three of Marmontel.<delimiter>Once Martin Zadek casts his spell,<delimiter>Tanya surrenders to his glamour…<delimiter>He brings her solace when she grieves,<delimiter>He sleeps with her and never leaves.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
The dream disturbs her. In confusion,<delimiter>Not knowing what it presages,<delimiter>She seeks a meaningful solution<delimiter>To all its monstrous images.<delimiter>Arranged in alphabetic order,<delimiter>The index gives the words that awed her:<delimiter>A bear, a blizzard, little bridge,<delimiter>Dark, fir, a forest, hedgehog, witch<delimiter>And so on. Tanya’s reservations<delimiter>A Martin Zadek won’t dispel,<delimiter>And yet her nightmare does foretell<delimiter>A multitude of sad occasions.<delimiter>For several days thereafter she<delimiter>Keeps thinking of it anxiously.
<h1>XXV</h1>
But lo, her crimson hand extending,<delimiter>Daybreak, from valleys large and small,<delimiter>Leads forth the folk who’ll be attending<delimiter>A merry nameday festival.<delimiter>From morn the Larin home’s abounding<delimiter>With neighbours from estates surrounding;<delimiter>Whole families have made their way<delimiter>On britska, coach, kibitka, sleigh.<delimiter>There’s jostling as the hall is filling,<delimiter>In the salon new faces, hugs,<delimiter>Girls’ smacking kisses, barking pugs,<delimiter>Noise, laughter, crush as more folk spill in,<delimiter>Guests make their bows and shuffle by,<delimiter>Wet-nurses shout and children cry.

Together with a spouse well nourished,<delimiter>There entered portly Pustyakov;<delimiter>Gvozdin, a splendid lord who flourished<delimiter>On peasant farmers badly off;<delimiter>Then the Skotinins, grey-haired, prospering<delimiter>With their innumerable offspring<delimiter>From thirty-odd right down to two;<delimiter>And Petushkov, our fop, came, too;<delimiter>Then my first cousin, one Buyanov,<delimiter>In pointed cap and cloaked with fluff<delimiter>(But you must know him well enough);<delimiter>And councillor-in-retirement, Flyanov,<delimiter>A scandalmonger, seasoned cheat,<delimiter>And bribe-taker who loved to eat.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
The family of Kharlikov had<delimiter>Monsieur Triquet within its fold;<delimiter>A noted wit, late from Tambov, clad<delimiter>In reddish wig, bespectacled.<delimiter>Triquet, in truly Gallic manner,<delimiter>Had brought a stanza for Tatiana,<delimiter>Set to a children’s melody:<delimiter>Réveillez-vous, belle endormie.<delimiter>This stanza saw its publication<delimiter>In a decrepit almanac;<delimiter>Triquet, a poet with a knack,<delimiter>Redeemed it from disintegration,<delimiter>And in the place of belle Nina<delimiter>He boldly put belle Tatiana.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
And now from an adjacent quarter<delimiter>A company commander came,<delimiter>The idol of each ripened daughter<delimiter>And district mothers, all aflame.<delimiter>He entered… ah now, what’s he saying?<delimiter>The regimental band is playing,<delimiter>The colonel has arranged it all,<delimiter>What fun! There is to be a ball!<delimiter>The young things skip, anticipating;<delimiter>But dinner being served brings calm,<delimiter>All go to table, arm in arm,<delimiter>The grown-up girls near Tanya waiting,<delimiter>The men en face; a buzz goes round;<delimiter>All cross themselves as seats are found.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
A sudden ceasing of the chatter;<delimiter>Mouths chew; and, meanwhile, all about,<delimiter>Crockery, plates and covers clatter<delimiter>And clinking wine-glasses ring out.<delimiter>But soon the guests by small gradations<delimiter>Revive their deafening conversations.<delimiter>They shout, laugh, argue through the meal,<delimiter>Nobody listens, ladies squeal.<delimiter>The doors fly open, Lensky enters,<delimiter>With him Onegin. ‘Lord, at last!’<delimiter>Cries out Dame Larina, and fast<delimiter>The guests make room, as each one ventures<delimiter>To move a cover or a chair;<delimiter>They seat the two young friends with care.
<h1>XXX</h1>
They sit right opposite Tatiana;<delimiter>She, paler than the moon at morn,<delimiter>More agitated in her manner<delimiter>Than hunted doe, stays looking down<delimiter>With darkening eyes; a glow pervades her,<delimiter>A surge of passion suffocates her;<delimiter>She does not hear from our two friends<delimiter>The salutation each extends;<delimiter>About to cry, poor thing, she’s ready<delimiter>To fall into a swoon or faint;<delimiter>But will and reason bring restraint;<delimiter>Clenching her teeth, remaining steady,<delimiter>She quietly utters just a word<delimiter>And from the table has not stirred.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
With tragi-nervous demonstrations,<delimiter>With maidens’ fainting fits and tears<delimiter>Eugene had long since lost all patience:<delimiter>He’d had enough of them for years.<delimiter>Finding himself at this huge banquet,<delimiter>The oddball was already angry.<delimiter>But noticing the languid maid’s<delimiter>Disquiet, he, with lowered gaze,<delimiter>Fell sulking and, with indignation,<delimiter>Swore he would madden Lensky and<delimiter>Avenge himself on every hand.<delimiter>Rejoicing in anticipation,<delimiter>He in his soul began to sketch<delimiter>Caricatures of every guest.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
Of course, it was not just Onegin<delimiter>Who could detect Tatiana’s plight,<delimiter>But at that moment all were taking<delimiter>Cognizance of a pie in sight<delimiter>(Alas, too salty for the throttle).<delimiter>Meanwhile, inside a pitch-sealed bottle<delimiter>Between the meat and blanc-manger<delimiter>Tsimlyansky wine goes on display,<delimiter>Followed by long and narrow glasses,<delimiter>So like your waist, Zizi, so small,<delimiter>The crystal pattern of my soul,<delimiter>The object of my guiltless verses,<delimiter>The vial of love’s enticing brew —<delimiter>How often I got drunk on you!
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
The damp cork pops, the bottle’s emptied,<delimiter>The glasses fizz with ancient wine;<delimiter>Then, by his stanza long tormented,<delimiter>Triquet with ceremonial sign<delimiter>Stands up; and all the guests before him<delimiter>Are still. Unable to ignore him,<delimiter>Tatiana’s scarce alive; Triquet,<delimiter>Holding a paper, turns her way<delimiter>And starts his song, off-key. He’s fêted<delimiter>With shouts and calls, the guests clap hard,<delimiter>She owes a curtsey to the bard;<delimiter>The poet, great but underrated,<delimiter>Is first to drink her health, and she<delimiter>Accepts his stanza gracefully.
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
Homage, congratulations greet her;<delimiter>In turn Tatiana thanks each guest.<delimiter>Then, as Onegin comes to meet her,<delimiter>The maiden’s air, her lack of zest,<delimiter>Her discomposure, tired expression<delimiter>Engender in his soul compassion:<delimiter>He simply bows, yet in his eyes<delimiter>Tatiana catches with surprise<delimiter>A look miraculously tender.<delimiter>Whether indeed he feels regret<delimiter>Or plays with her like a coquette,<delimiter>This wondrous look appears to mend her:<delimiter>True tenderness in it she sees,<delimiter>It puts Tatiana’s heart at ease.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
The chairs are pushed back in a clatter,<delimiter>The drawing-room receives the crowd,<delimiter>So bees from honied hives will scatter<delimiter>To cornfields in a noisy cloud.<delimiter>Contented with their festive labours,<delimiter>The locals snuffle to their neighbours;<delimiter>Ladies sit by the chimney-place;<delimiter>Girls whisper in a corner space;<delimiter>The men unfold the green baize tables,<delimiter>Boston and ancient omber call<delimiter>The ardent players to their thrall,<delimiter>Whist too, still one of players’ staples —<delimiter>But what a dull consortium,<delimiter>All sons of avid tedium!
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
Whist’s gallant heroes have completed<delimiter>Eight rubbers; and as many times,<delimiter>Having changed places, are reseated;<delimiter>Now tea is served. We hear no chimes:<delimiter>I like to time repasts at leisure<delimiter>With dinner, supper, tea my measure.<delimiter>We countryfolk make little fuss<delimiter>Without Bréguet to govern us:<delimiter>Our stomach is our faultless timer;<delimiter>And, by the way, I like to talk<delimiter>As much of dishes, feasts and cork,<delimiter>In my capacity as rhymer,<delimiter>As you did, Homer, bard divine<delimiter>Whom thirty centuries enshrine.
<h1>XXXVII. XXXVIII. XXXIX</h1>
But tea is brought; the dainty maidens<delimiter>Have scarce their saucers in their hand,<delimiter>When from the hall they hear the cadence<delimiter>Of flute, bassoon — the army band.<delimiter>By music’s thunder animated,<delimiter>His tea-and-rum cup relegated,<delimiter>Our Paris of the towns about,<delimiter>Our Petushkov seeks Olga out,<delimiter>Then Lensky Tanya; Kharlikova,<delimiter>A seasoned maid, not married off,<delimiter>Falls to our poet from Tambov,<delimiter>Buyanov whirls off Pustyakova,<delimiter>And all have spilled into the hall,<delimiter>And in full glory shines the ball.
<h1>XL</h1>
When I began this composition<delimiter>(My Chapter One you will recall),<delimiter>I wanted with Albani’s vision<delimiter>To paint a Petersburgian ball.<delimiter>But, by an empty dream’s deflection,<delimiter>I got engrossed in recollection<delimiter>Of once-familiar little feet<delimiter>Along whose narrow tracks so neat<delimiter>I swear I’ll go no more a-roving!<delimiter>With youth betrayed, its time for me<delimiter>To learn to live more sensibly,<delimiter>My deeds and diction need improving,<delimiter>And this Fifth Chapter I shall cleanse<delimiter>Of its digressions, when it ends.
<h1>XLI</h1>
Monotonous and madly whirling,<delimiter>Like young life’s whirl, when spirits soar,<delimiter>The waltz revolves, the music swirling,<delimiter>The couples flick across the floor.<delimiter>The moment for revenge arriving,<delimiter>Onegin, chuckling and reviving,<delimiter>Approaches Olga. Rapidly,<delimiter>He twirls her near the company,<delimiter>Then seats her on a chair, proceeding<delimiter>To talk to her of this or that;<delimiter>One or two minutes spent on chat,<delimiter>And they rejoin the waltz, unheeding;<delimiter>The guests are taken by surprise,<delimiter>Poor Lensky can’t believe his eyes.
<h1>XLII</h1>
Now the mazurka has resounded.<delimiter>Once, when you heard its thunder peal,<delimiter>A giant ballroom shook and pounded,<delimiter>The parquet cracking under heel.<delimiter>The very window-frames vibrated;<delimiter>Today, like ladies, understated,<delimiter>We glide across the lacquered boards;<delimiter>But in small towns and country wards<delimiter>There the mazurka thrives, retaining<delimiter>Its pristine charms: the leap and dash,<delimiter>The play of heel, and the moustache;<delimiter>These have not changed at all, remaining<delimiter>Immune to wanton fashion’s sway,<delimiter>The Russian sickness of today.
<h1>XLIII. XLIV</h1>
My irrepressible Buyanov<delimiter>Took Olga and Tatiana then<delimiter>To meet Eugene, who promptly ran off<delimiter>With Olga to the ball again.<delimiter>He guides her, nonchalantly gliding,<delimiter>And in a whisper, bends, confiding<delimiter>A madrigal, the merest slush,<delimiter>Squeezes her hand — her rosy flush<delimiter>Takes on a brighter coloration,<delimiter>Infusing her complacent face.<delimiter>My Lensky, watching this take place,<delimiter>Flares up with jealous indignation<delimiter>And by the long mazurka vexed,<delimiter>Solicits the cotillion next.
<h1>XLV</h1>
It isn’t possible, she tells him,<delimiter>Eugene already has her word.<delimiter>Not possible? Ah, she repels him,<delimiter>She could… good God, what has he heard?<delimiter>Scarce out of swaddling, always mild,<delimiter>Now a coquette, a giddy child!<delimiter>Already versed in artful play,<delimiter>She’s learned already to betray!<delimiter>The blow’s too much for Lensky; cursing<delimiter>The sex’s tricks, he leaves the hall,<delimiter>Calls for a horse, and, full of gall,<delimiter>Gallops away, in thought rehearsing:<delimiter>A brace of pistols, bullets two —<delimiter>Enough for fate to take its due.
<h1>Chapter VI</h1>
<i>La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi,<delimiter>Nasce una gente a cui ‘l morir non dole.</i><delimiter>Petrarch
<h1>I</h1>
On noticing his friend had vanished,<delimiter>Onegin stayed at Olga’s side,<delimiter>Pensive, again to boredom banished,<delimiter>Content with vengeance satisfied,<delimiter>Now Olen’ka like him was yawning,<delimiter>Her eyes in search of Lensky turning,<delimiter>While the cotillion’s endless stream<delimiter>Oppressed her like a grievous dream.<delimiter>But it has ended. Supper’s ready.<delimiter>The beds are made. The guests are all<delimiter>Assigned their place from entrance-hall<delimiter>To housemaids’ quarters. All are needy<delimiter>Of restful sleep. Alone Eugene<delimiter>Drives home from this domestic scene.
<h1>II</h1>
All’s calm: from the salon ascended<delimiter>The snores of heavy Pustyakov,<delimiter>Beside his heavy wife extended.<delimiter>Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov<delimiter>And Flyanov (somewhat over-sated)<delimiter>Were on the dinner chairs located,<delimiter>And on the floor Monsieur Triquet<delimiter>In vest and ancient nightcap lay.<delimiter>The rooms of Olga and Tatiana<delimiter>Were full of sleeping girls. Alone<delimiter>And sad, Tatiana shone,<delimiter>Illuminated by Diana;<delimiter>To sleep, poor thing, she could not yield<delimiter>And gazed upon the darkened field.
<h1>III</h1>
Tatiana to her soul is riven<delimiter>By Eugene’s unexpected call,<delimiter>The sudden tender look he’d given,<delimiter>His strange approach to Olga — all<delimiter>Distresses her and makes her wonder,<delimiter>To understand him’s quite beyond her:<delimiter>A jealous anguish makes her start,<delimiter>As if a cold hand pressed her heart,<delimiter>As if a chasm, black and frightful,<delimiter>Had opened, roaring, under her.<delimiter>‘I’ll die,’ she says, but does not stir,<delimiter>‘To die from him will be delightful.<delimiter>I shan’t complain, for I confess<delimiter>He cannot bring me happiness.’
<h1>IV</h1>
But onward, onward with my story!<delimiter>Another character arrives.<delimiter>Five versts away from Krasnogorye<delimiter>(Lensky’s estate) there lives and thrives<delimiter>In philosophical seclusion<delimiter>Still to this day, without intrusion,<delimiter>Zaretsky, once a brawler and<delimiter>The hetman of a gaming band,<delimiter>Chieftain of rakes, a pub declaimer,<delimiter>But now, benign and simple, he<delimiter>Maintains a bachelor family;<delimiter>A steadfast friend, a squire grown tamer,<delimiter>He’s even honest — thus our age<delimiter>Improves itself at every stage.
<h1>V</h1>
Time was, he stood upon a pedestal,<delimiter>Society flattered him with praise:<delimiter>He was a maestro with a pistol<delimiter>Who could at twelve yards hit an ace,<delimiter>And once, engaged in actual battle,<delimiter>Enraptured, he displayed his mettle<delimiter>By falling from his Kalmuck steed<delimiter>Into the mud at daring speed;<delimiter>Drunk as a swine, this precious hostage<delimiter>Surrendered to a Gallic squad,<delimiter>A modern Regulus, honour’s god,<delimiter>Prepared to yield again to bondage,<delimiter>To drain on credit two or three<delimiter>Carafes each morning chez Véry.
<h1>VI</h1>
To tease was once his recreation,<delimiter>He’d dupe a fool or stupefy<delimiter>A man of educated station,<delimiter>In public gaze or on the sly,<delimiter>Although some tricks he perpetrated<delimiter>Did not remain uncastigated,<delimiter>And sometimes, like a simple chap,<delimiter>He’d fall himself into a trap.<delimiter>He could dispute and be amusing,<delimiter>Respond with answers, smart or dumb,<delimiter>At times judiciously keep mum<delimiter>Or be judiciously abusing,<delimiter>Encourage two young friends to strife<delimiter>And set them duelling for their life,
<h1>VII</h1>
Alternatively reconcile them,<delimiter>Arrange a breakfast for the three,<delimiter>And, later, secretly revile them<delimiter>With merry jokes and braggartry.<delimiter>Sed alia tempora!Audacity<delimiter>(Like lover’s dream, another vanity)<delimiter>Departs when lively youth has fled.<delimiter>And my Zaretsky, as I said,<delimiter>Lives like a sage, discovering solace<delimiter>Where bird cherry, acacia climb;<delimiter>Sheltered from storms, he spends his time<delimiter>In planting cabbages, like Horace,<delimiter>And breeding ducks and geese, is free<delimiter>To teach his kids their ABC.
<h1>VIII</h1>
He was not stupid; and, despising<delimiter>The heart in him, Eugene admired<delimiter>The spirit of his judgements, prizing<delimiter>The sound opinions he’d acquired.<delimiter>Eugene was always pleased to meet him<delimiter>And so was not surprised to greet him<delimiter>When, in the morning, Eugene saw<delimiter>His neighbour standing at the door.<delimiter>With salutations done, Zaretsky<delimiter>Broke off the chat that they’d begun<delimiter>And, eyes a-twinkle with the fun,<delimiter>Passed on to him a note from Lensky.<delimiter>Onegin to the window went<delimiter>And read the note the poet sent.
<h1>IX</h1>
It was a gentlemanly letter,<delimiter>A challenge or cartel he’d penned;<delimiter>Polite and cold and to the matter<delimiter>He sought a duel with his friend.<delimiter>Eugene’s immediate reaction<delimiter>To this demand for satisfaction<delimiter>Was swift enough. Discussion spared,<delimiter>He said he’d ‘always be prepared’.<delimiter>Zaretsky rose without explaining,<delimiter>Not wishing to prolong his stay,<delimiter>For household business claimed the day,<delimiter>He left forthwith; Eugene, remaining<delimiter>Alone, encountering his soul,<delimiter>Was not contented with his role.
<h1>X</h1>
Indeed, a strict examination<delimiter>Before a secret, inner court<delimiter>Engendered much self-accusation:<delimiter>First, that he’d not the right to sport<delimiter>Last evening in such casual fashion<delimiter>With Lensky’s timid, tender passion;<delimiter>Then… why not let a poet play<delimiter>The fool at eighteen, while he may.<delimiter>Eugene, who loved him as a brother,<delimiter>Might well have proved, by seeking peace,<delimiter>To be no ball of prejudice<delimiter>That’s batted one way or another,<delimiter>No fiery boy, no fighting kind,<delimiter>But man of honour, with a mind.
<h1>XI</h1>
He might have manifested feeling<delimiter>Instead of bristling like a beast,<delimiter>He should have set about the healing<delimiter>Of Lensky’s heart. Such thoughts soon ceased.<delimiter>‘Too late now, everything is settled,<delimiter>Now this old duellist has meddled<delimiter>In the affair, what’s left to do?<delimiter>He’s vicious and a gossip, too.<delimiter>The answer to his droll dominion<delimiter>Should be contempt, of course, but then<delimiter>The whispers, laughs of stupid men…’<delimiter>And there it is — public opinion!<delimiter>Our idol, honour’s spring, which, wound,<delimiter>Ensures our universe goes round.
<h1>XII</h1>
Lensky, at home, with hatred blazing,<delimiter>Awaits the answer fretfully;<delimiter>His neighbour in the finest phrasing<delimiter>Conveys it with solemnity.<delimiter>This sets the jealous poet cheering;<delimiter>The prankster might — so he’d been fearing —<delimiter>Treat the occasion as a jest,<delimiter>And by some ruse avert his breast<delimiter>And duck the pistol by retreating.<delimiter>These doubts resolved, tomorrow they<delimiter>Must at the mill ere break of day<delimiter>Embark upon their fateful meeting,<delimiter>To raise the cock and, taking aim,<delimiter>A temple or a thigh to claim.
<h1>XIII</h1>
Detesting a coquette so cruel,<delimiter>Still seething, Lensky sought to shun<delimiter>A rendezvous before the duel,<delimiter>He kept consulting watch and sun.<delimiter>The wish to meet, though, was compelling,<delimiter>Soon Lensky’s at the sisters’ dwelling.<delimiter>Olga, he thought, would be upset<delimiter>And agitated when they met;<delimiter>But not a bit of it: on spying<delimiter>The desolate bard, as in the past<delimiter>She skipped down from the porch as fast<delimiter>As giddy hope, towards him flying,<delimiter>Light-hearted, free of care, serene —<delimiter>In fact, as she had always been.
<h1>XIV</h1>
‘Last night, why did you leave so early?’<delimiter>Was what his Olen’ka first said.<delimiter>His senses clouded, and he merely,<delimiter>Without replying, hung his head.<delimiter>Vexation, jealousy were banished,<delimiter>Before her shining look they vanished,<delimiter>Before her soft simplicity,<delimiter>Before her soul’s vivacity!<delimiter>He gazes with sweet feeling, heartened<delimiter>To see that he’s still loved; and longs<delimiter>Already, burdened by his wrongs,<delimiter>To ask her whether he’ll be pardoned,<delimiter>He trembles, can’t think what to say,<delimiter>He’s happy, almost well today…
<h1>XV. XVI. XVII</h1>
Pensive again, again dejected,<delimiter>Vladimir, under Olga’s sway,<delimiter>Is not sufficiently collected<delimiter>To speak to her of yesterday;<delimiter>‘I,’ he reflects, ‘will be her saviour.<delimiter>I shall not suffer that depraver<delimiter>To tempt a maiden’s innocence<delimiter>With fiery sighs and compliments;<delimiter>Nor let a worm with venom slither<delimiter>A lily’s stalklet to enfold,<delimiter>Nor see a flower two days old,<delimiter>Half-opened still, condemned to wither.’<delimiter>All this, friends, signified: I shall<delimiter>Soon fire a bullet at my pal.
<h1>XVIII</h1>
If he had known what wound was burning<delimiter>My dear Tatiana’s heart! If she<delimiter>Had been aware, in some way learning,<delimiter>If she’d been able to foresee<delimiter>That Lensky, Eugene would be vying<delimiter>To find a grave for one to lie in;<delimiter>Who knows, her love perhaps might then<delimiter>Have reconciled the friends again!<delimiter>But no one had as yet discovered,<delimiter>Even by chance, their angry feud.<delimiter>On everything Eugene was mute,<delimiter>Tatiana quietly pined and suffered;<delimiter>The nurse might just have known of it,<delimiter>But she, alas, was slow of wit.
<h1>XIX</h1>
All evening Lensky was abstracted,<delimiter>Now taciturn, now gay. Somehow,<delimiter>A person by the Muse protected,<delimiter>Is always thus: with knitted brow,<delimiter>To the clavier he’d wander, playing<delimiter>A string of chords, no more assaying,<delimiter>Or whisper, seeing Olga near,<delimiter>‘I’m happy, am I not, my dear?’<delimiter>But it was late, his heart was aching,<delimiter>He must depart, yet as he bade<delimiter>Goodbye to her, his youthful maid,<delimiter>His heart was on the point of breaking.<delimiter>She looks at him: ‘What is it?’ ‘Oh,<delimiter>It’s nothing, Olga, I must go.’
<h1>XX</h1>
Arriving home, he first inspected<delimiter>His pistols, ready for the fight,<delimiter>Put them away, undressed, reflected<delimiter>On Schiller’s verse by candlelight.<delimiter>But by one thought he’s overtaken,<delimiter>His melancholy does not slacken:<delimiter>He sees before him Olga full<delimiter>Of beauty inexplicable.<delimiter>Vladimir closes Schiller’s verses,<delimiter>Takes up his pen and writes his own —<delimiter>Nonsense to which a lover’s prone;<delimiter>It sings and flows. And he rehearses<delimiter>His lines aloud, by fervour seized,<delimiter>Like drunken Delvig at a feast.
<h1>XXI</h1>
By chance his verse can still be read now,<delimiter>I have it, ready for your gaze:<delimiter>‘Whither, ah whither are you fled now,<delimiter>My springtime’s ever-golden days?<delimiter>What is the coming day’s decision?<delimiter>Alas, it lies beyond my vision,<delimiter>Enshrouded in the deepest night.<delimiter>No matter, fate’s decree is right.<delimiter>Whether I’m pierced by an arrow<delimiter>Or whether it should miss — all’s well:<delimiter>A predetermined hour will tell<delimiter>If we’re to wake or sleep tomorrow:<delimiter>Blest are the cares that day contrives,<delimiter>Blest is the darkness that arrives!
<h1>XXII</h1>
‘When daybreak comes with rays ascending<delimiter>And sparkling day dispels the gloom,<delimiter>Then I, perhaps — I’ll be descending<delimiter>Into the mystery of the tomb,<delimiter>Slow Lethe will engulf for ever<delimiter>My young poetical endeavour;<delimiter>I’ll be forgot, but you’ll return<delimiter>To weep on my untimely urn,<delimiter>And, maid of beauty, in your sorrow,<delimiter>You will reflect: he loved me, sworn<delimiter>To me alone in his sad dawn,<delimiter>Bereft now of its stormy morrow!…<delimiter>Come, heartfelt friend, come, longed-for friend,<delimiter>I’ll be your husband to the end.’
<h1>XXIII</h1>
And so he wrote obscurely, limply<delimiter>(Romantic is the term we’ve coined,<delimiter>Though what’s Romantic here I simply<delimiter>Have no idea; and what’s the point?),<delimiter>And finally, as night was ending,<delimiter>His head towards his shoulder bending,<delimiter>Vladimir dozed, while lingering still<delimiter>Upon the modish word ideal;<delimiter>But scarcely lost in sleep’s enchantment,<delimiter>He does not hear his neighbour, who<delimiter>Enters the silent study to<delimiter>Awaken him with a commandment:<delimiter>‘Time to get up, past six, we’re late,<delimiter>Onegin will not want to wait.’
<h1>XXIV</h1>
But he was wrong: Eugene unheeding<delimiter>Still sleeps a sleep that nought can mar.<delimiter>Night’s shades already are receding,<delimiter>The cock salutes the morning star,<delimiter>Onegin sleeps on at his leisure,<delimiter>The sun climbs high into the azure,<delimiter>A passing snowstorm overhead<delimiter>Glitters and whirls. But from his bed<delimiter>Our dormant hero has not started,<delimiter>Sleep hovers still before his eyes.<delimiter>At last he wakes, prepares to rise,<delimiter>The curtains of his bed he’s parted;<delimiter>He looks outside — and sees, alack,<delimiter>He should have started some time back.
<h1>XXV</h1>
He rings: his valet, French and chipper,<delimiter>Reaches his chamber in a flash,<delimiter>Guillot brings dressing-gown and slipper,<delimiter>And hands him linen with panache.<delimiter>Onegin hurries with his dressing,<delimiter>Informs his man that time is pressing,<delimiter>That he must take the duelling-case,<delimiter>That they must leave, that they must race.<delimiter>The sleigh is ready; Eugene, seated,<delimiter>Flies to the mill, the horses strain.<delimiter>He tells his valet to retain<delimiter>Lepage’s fatal tubes till needed,<delimiter>And have the horses moved to where<delimiter>Two oaklings stand, and leave them there.
<h1>XXVI</h1>
Leaning upon the dam stood Lensky<delimiter>Who’d waited there impatiently,<delimiter>While rural engineer Zaretsky<delimiter>Surveyed the millstone critically.<delimiter>Eugene arrives and makes excuses.<delimiter>‘That’s very well, but where the deuce is<delimiter>Your second, then?’ Zaretsky cried.<delimiter>In duels he took a pedant’s pride,<delimiter>Methodical by intuition:<delimiter>To stretch out someone on the ground<delimiter>Any old how was quite unsound,<delimiter>One must obey a strict tradition<delimiter>And follow rules of ancient days<delimiter>(For which we should accord him praise).
<h1>XXVII</h1>
‘My second? Yes, let me present him,<delimiter>He’s here: Monsieur Guillot, my friend,<delimiter>I do not see what should prevent him,<delimiter>He’s someone I can recommend.<delimiter>Although he’s not a well-known figure,<delimiter>He is an honest guy and eager.’<delimiter>Zaretsky bit his lip, appalled.<delimiter>Onegin then to Lensky called:<delimiter>‘Shall we not start now?’ ‘If you’re willing,’<delimiter>Vladimir said. Behind the mill<delimiter>They went. At some remove, meanwhile,<delimiter>Zaretsky solemnly is sealing<delimiter>A contract with the ‘honest guy’.<delimiter>The two foes stand with lowered eye.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
How long since they from one another<delimiter>Were parted by a thirst to kill?<delimiter>How long since, each to each a brother,<delimiter>They’d shared their leisure time, a meal<delimiter>And thoughts? But now with grim impatience,<delimiter>As in a feud of generations<delimiter>Or frightful dream that makes no sense<delimiter>Each, cool and silent, must commence<delimiter>To wreak the other one’s destruction…<delimiter>Should they not stop and laugh instead<delimiter>Before their hands have turned blood red,<delimiter>Should they not spurn the duel’s seduction?…<delimiter>But what the world cannot abide<delimiter>Are bogus shame and lack of pride.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
The pistols glistened; soon the mallets<delimiter>Resoundingly on ramrods flicked,<delimiter>Through cut-steel barrels went the bullets,<delimiter>The cock has for the first time clicked.<delimiter>A greyish powder was decanted<delimiter>Into the pan, and the indented,<delimiter>Securely screwed-in flint raised high<delimiter>Once more. Behind a stump nearby<delimiter>Guillot was standing, disconcerted.<delimiter>The foes cast off their cloaks, meanwhile<delimiter>Zaretsky measured off in style<delimiter>Thirty-two steps and then diverted<delimiter>His friends towards the farthest pace,<delimiter>Each took his pistol to the place.
<h1>XXX</h1>
‘Now march,’ came the command. And readily,<delimiter>As if the two had never met,<delimiter>The erstwhile comrades slowly, steadily<delimiter>Advanced four steps, not aiming yet,<delimiter>Four fatal steps the two had taken.<delimiter>And then, advancing still, Onegin<delimiter>Raised by degrees his pistol first.<delimiter>Five further paces they traversed.<delimiter>And likewise Lensky calculated,<delimiter>Closed his left eye, as he took aim —<delimiter>But, with a sudden burst of flame,<delimiter>Onegin fired… the moment fated<delimiter>Had struck: the poet, with no sound,<delimiter>Let drop his pistol to the ground.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
His hand upon his breast he presses<delimiter>Softly, and falls, as, misty-eyed,<delimiter>His gaze not pain, but death expresses.<delimiter>Thus, slowly, on a mountain-side<delimiter>A mound of snow, already teetering,<delimiter>Descends with sunny sparkles glittering.<delimiter>Onegin, shuddering, swiftly flies<delimiter>To where the young Vladimir lies,<delimiter>He looks and calls… but there’s no power<delimiter>Can bring him back. The youthful bard<delimiter>Has met an end untimely. Hard<delimiter>The storm has blown, the finest flower<delimiter>Has withered at the morning’s dawn,<delimiter>The fire upon the altar’s gone.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
He lay inert; uncanny-seeming,<delimiter>A languid peace showed on his brow.<delimiter>Beneath his breast the blood flowed, steaming,<delimiter>The shot had gone right through him. How<delimiter>One moment earlier inspiration<delimiter>And love and hate, and aspiration<delimiter>Had in this heart vibrated, churned,<delimiter>How life had revelled, blood had burned;<delimiter>But now, as in a house forsaken,<delimiter>All it contains is dark and still,<delimiter>A home forever silent, chill,<delimiter>The windows shuttered, chalked and vacant,<delimiter>The mistress vanished from the place<delimiter>To God knows where, without a trace.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
It’s pleasant with a verse to chasten<delimiter>A dunderheaded clown and foe,<delimiter>Pleasant to watch the fellow hasten<delimiter>With butting horns descending low<delimiter>To view his image in a mirror<delimiter>And turn from it in shame and horror;<delimiter>More pleasant, friends, if he howls out:<delimiter>‘Oh look, that’s me there!’ like a lout;<delimiter>Still pleasanter with quiet persistence<delimiter>To plan a grave that lauds his name<delimiter>And at his pallid brow take aim<delimiter>From proper gentlemanly distance;<delimiter>It’s hardly pleasant, though, you’ll find<delimiter>To send him off to meet his kind.
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
What happens if your young companion<delimiter>Is slaughtered by your pistol shot<delimiter>For some presumptuous glance, opinion<delimiter>Or repartee worth not a jot,<delimiter>Insulting you while you were drinking,<delimiter>Or if, in fiery pique, not thinking,<delimiter>He calls you proudly to a duel,<delimiter>Tell me the feelings that would rule<delimiter>Your soul, when without motion lying<delimiter>In front of you upon the earth,<delimiter>Upon his brow the hue of death,<delimiter>He slowly stiffens, ossifying,<delimiter>When to your desperate appeal<delimiter>He is insensitive and still?
<h1>XXXV</h1>
With sharpening contrition growing,<delimiter>Gripping the pistol in his hand,<delimiter>Onegin watched Vladimir’s going.<delimiter>‘Well then, he’s dead, you understand,’<delimiter>Pronounced the neighbour. Dead! Onegin,<delimiter>Crushed by the utterance, walks off, quaking,<delimiter>To call his people. Straightaway,<delimiter>Zaretsky gently on the sleigh<delimiter>Settles the frozen corpse, escorting<delimiter>The dreadful treasure to its home.<delimiter>Sensing the corpse, the horses foam,<delimiter>Wetting the steel bit, chafing, snorting,<delimiter>But when they’re ready to depart,<delimiter>They fly as swiftly as a dart.
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
My friends, you’re sorry for the poet:<delimiter>Amid the bloom of hope, desire<delimiter>From which the world will never profit,<delimiter>And scarcely out of child’s attire,<delimiter>Gone! Where’s the ardent agitation,<delimiter>Where is the noble aspiration<delimiter>Of youthful feeling, youthful thought,<delimiter>Audacious, tender, highly wrought?<delimiter>Where, too, is love’s acclaimed impatience,<delimiter>The thirst for knowledge, thirst for work,<delimiter>The dread where vice and shame may lurk,<delimiter>And you, most cherished ruminations,<delimiter>You, phantoms of unearthly life,<delimiter>You, dreams with sacred verses rife!
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
Perhaps he was for good intended<delimiter>Or at the very least for fame;<delimiter>His silenced lyre might have extended<delimiter>Its sound through centuries to come<delimiter>With ringing music. There awaited<delimiter>Perhaps a special niche created<delimiter>For him at an exalted site.<delimiter>Perhaps his martyred shade in flight<delimiter>Carried away a holy secret,<delimiter>Remaining with him, and the joys<delimiter>Are lost of an uplifting voice,<delimiter>While from beyond the gravestone’s remit<delimiter>No hymn will rush to where he’s laid,<delimiter>Nor peoples come to bless his shade.

But then again the poet’s portion<delimiter>Might well have been quite commonplace.<delimiter>The years of youth give way to caution,<delimiter>Slowing the soul’s impetuous pace.<delimiter>Of poetry he might have wearied,<delimiter>And, parting from the Muses, married;<delimiter>A happy squire, with cuckold’s crown,<delimiter>Wearing a quilted dressing gown;<delimiter>He might have learned life’s true dimension,<delimiter>At forty he’d have had the gout,<delimiter>Drunk, eaten, moped, declined, got stout<delimiter>And died according to convention<delimiter>As children thronged and women cried<delimiter>And village quacks stood by his side.

But, reader, we shall never know it;<delimiter>Sufficient that upon a field<delimiter>A youthful lover, dreamer, poet<delimiter>Has by a friendly hand been killed!<delimiter>A leftward path from the location<delimiter>Where dwelt that child of inspiration<delimiter>Leads to two pines with roots entwined,<delimiter>Beneath which tiny currents wind<delimiter>Out of the valley’s brook they border.<delimiter>The ploughman rests beside their brink<delimiter>And female reapers come to sink<delimiter>Their ringing pitchers in the water;<delimiter>There, by the brook, in deepest shade,<delimiter>A simple monument is laid.

A herdsman to the tomb retreating<delimiter>Sings (as the spring rain dots the grass)<delimiter>Of Volga fishermen, while plaiting<delimiter>His mottled sandals made of bast.<delimiter>A young townswoman who is spending<delimiter>Her summer in the country, wending<delimiter>On horseback through the fields alone,<delimiter>Rides headlong, comes upon the stone<delimiter>And halts her steed, before it pausing,<delimiter>As, tightening the leather leads,<delimiter>She lifts her veil of gauze and reads<delimiter>The plain inscription quickly, causing<delimiter>A tear to dim her tender eyes<delimiter>At Lensky’s premature demise.
<h1>XLII</h1>
And, at a trot, she rides through meadows,<delimiter>Sunk a long time in reverie,<delimiter>Her soul pervaded by the shadows<delimiter>Cast by the poet’s destiny;<delimiter>And wonders: ‘How did Olga suffer?<delimiter>Was it for long she mourned her lover?<delimiter>Or did she only briefly rue?<delimiter>And where’s her sister now? Where, too,<delimiter>Is he, the fugitive, the hermit,<delimiter>Of modish belles the modish foe,<delimiter>Where did that gloomy oddball go,<delimiter>The slayer of the youthful poet?’<delimiter>I promise in due time I’ll bring<delimiter>A full account of everything,

But not today. Although my feeling<delimiter>For Eugene has not changed a bit,<delimiter>Though I’ll return to him, unfailing,<delimiter>Right now I am not up to it.<delimiter>To Spartan prose the years are turning,<delimiter>Coquettish rhyme the years are spurning;<delimiter>And I — I with a sigh confess —<delimiter>I’m running after her much less.<delimiter>My pen has lost its former pleasures<delimiter>Of daubing fleeting leaves, it seems,<delimiter>Today, quite different, chilling dreams;<delimiter>Quite different, unrelenting pressures,<delimiter>In stillness or in social noise,<delimiter>Disturb the sleep my soul enjoys.
<h1>XLIV</h1>
I’ve come to know new aspirations,<delimiter>I’ve come to know new sadness, too;<delimiter>The former hold no expectations,<delimiter>And earlier sadness still I rue.<delimiter>Where are my dreams, the dreams I cherished?<delimiter>What rhyme now follows, if not ‘perished’?<delimiter>And is the garland of my youth<delimiter>Withered at last, is this the truth?<delimiter>Is it the truth, all plain, unvarnished,<delimiter>Not in an elegiac cloak,<delimiter>That (hitherto said as a joke)<delimiter>The springtime of my days has vanished,<delimiter>Can’t be brought back and that I’m near<delimiter>Already to my thirtieth year?
<h1>XLV</h1>
The noontide of my life is starting,<delimiter>Which I must needs accept, I know;<delimiter>But oh, my light youth, if we’re parting,<delimiter>I want you as a friend to go!<delimiter>My thanks to you for the enjoyments,<delimiter>The sadness and the pleasant torments,<delimiter>The hubbub, storms, festivity,<delimiter>For all that you have given me;<delimiter>My thanks to you. I have delighted<delimiter>In you when times were turbulent,<delimiter>When times were calm… to full extent;<delimiter>Enough now! With a soul clear-sighted<delimiter>I set out on another quest<delimiter>And from my old life take a rest.

Let me glance back. Farewell, you arbours<delimiter>Where, in the backwoods, I recall<delimiter>Days filled with indolence and ardours<delimiter>And dreamings of a pensive soul.<delimiter>And you, my youthful inspiration.<delimiter>Keep stirring my imagination,<delimiter>My heart’s inertia vivify,<delimiter>More often to my corner fly.<delimiter>Let not a poet’s soul be frozen,<delimiter>Made rough and hard, reduced to bone<delimiter>And finally be turned to stone<delimiter>In that benumbing world he goes in,<delimiter>In that intoxicating slough<delimiter>Where, friends, we bathe together now.

Chased by the vernal beams, already<delimiter>Down the surrounding hills the snow<delimiter>Has run in turbid streams that eddy<delimiter>On to the flooded fields below;<delimiter>Nature, not yet from sleep returning,<delimiter>Greets with a smile the new year’s morning.<delimiter>The skies shine with a bluish sheen,<delimiter>Transparent still, the woods turn green,<delimiter>Lending the trees a downy cover,<delimiter>The bee flies from its waxen comb,<delimiter>Bringing the meadows’ tribute home.<delimiter>The dales dry out and colour over.<delimiter>Herds low, the hush of darkness brings<delimiter>The nightingale that newly sings.

How sad to me is spring’s arrival,<delimiter>Season of love, when all’s in bud!<delimiter>What languid tumult, what upheaval<delimiter>Disturb my soul, disturb my blood!<delimiter>With what a heavy, tender feeling<delimiter>I revel in the season, breathing<delimiter>The vernal wind that fans my face<delimiter>In some secluded, rural place!<delimiter>Or am I now estranged from pleasure,<delimiter>Does all that gladdens, animates,<delimiter>All that exults and radiates<delimiter>Cast boredom, languor in like measure<delimiter>Upon a soul long dead, does all<delimiter>Seem dark to it, funereal?

Or, cheerless, when the leaves of autumn<delimiter>Are resurrected by the spring,<delimiter>We recollect a bitter fortune,<delimiter>Hearing the woods’ new murmuring;<delimiter>Or we, in troubled contemplation<delimiter>Compare with nature’s animation<delimiter>The withered years of our estate,<delimiter>That nothing can resuscitate.<delimiter>Perhaps in thought we may recover,<delimiter>When caught in a poetic haze,<delimiter>Some other spring of older days<delimiter>That once more sets our hearts aquiver<delimiter>With dreams of some far distant clime,<delimiter>A wondrous night, a moon sublime…

It’s time: good idlers, I beseech you,<delimiter>Epicureans to the soul,<delimiter>You, fortune’s favourites, I entreat you, You,<delimiter>fledglings of the Lyovshin school,<delimiter>You rural Priams in your manors,<delimiter>You, ladies blessed with gentle manners,<delimiter>Spring calls you to the country soil,<delimiter>Season of warmth, of flowers and toil,<delimiter>Season of blissful walks and wandering,<delimiter>Betokening seductive nights.<delimiter>Quick, to the fields, the land invites<delimiter>Your coaches, ponderously trundling;<delimiter>By private horse or postal chaise,<delimiter>Forsake the city gates, make haste!

You, too, my reader, ever gracious,<delimiter>Into your foreign carriage climb,<delimiter>Leave now the noisy city spaces<delimiter>Where you caroused in winter time;<delimiter>On my capricious Muse depending,<delimiter>Let’s hear the oak wood’s sound ascending<delimiter>Above a river without name,<delimiter>Where my Eugene, the very same,<delimiter>Reclusive, idle and dejected,<delimiter>Spent winter only recently<delimiter>In Tanya’s close proximity,<delimiter>My dreaming maid whom he rejected;<delimiter>But now, no longer at his place,<delimiter>He’s left behind a dismal trace.

Midst hills in semi-circle lying,<delimiter>Let us go thither where a brook,<delimiter>By way of a green meadow plying,<delimiter>Runs through a linden, forest nook.<delimiter>The nightingale, through night’s long hours,<delimiter>Sings to the spring; the dog rose flowers,<delimiter>And there is heard the source’s sound —<delimiter>There, too, a tombstone can be found<delimiter>Beside two ancient pines umbrageous.<delimiter>The inscription tells the passer-by:<delimiter>‘Vladimir Lensky doth here lie,<delimiter>Who died a young man and courageous,<delimiter>Aged such and such, in such a year.<delimiter>Young poet, rest and slumber here.’

Upon a pine branch, low inclining,<delimiter>Time was, there hung a secret wreath,<delimiter>Rocked by the breeze of early morning<delimiter>Over that humble urn beneath.<delimiter>Time was, two girls in evening leisure<delimiter>Would come to mourn this doleful treasure,<delimiter>And, on the grave, in moonlight glow,<delimiter>Embracing, they would weep… but now<delimiter>The monument’s forgot by people.<delimiter>The trail to it is overgrown,<delimiter>The wreath upon the bough is gone.<delimiter>Alone, beside it, grey and feeble,<delimiter>The shepherd sings still as before,<delimiter>Plaiting his wretched shoes of yore.
<h1>VIII. IX. X</h1>
My poor, poor Lensky! Pining, aching,<delimiter>Not long did his beloved weep,<delimiter>Soon was the youthful bride forsaking<delimiter>A grief that went not very deep.<delimiter>Another captured her attention,<delimiter>Another’s flattering intervention<delimiter>Restored the sufferer to calm,<delimiter>A lancer wooed with practised charm,<delimiter>And, by this lancer overpowered,<delimiter>Already at the altar she<delimiter>Stands with becoming modesty<delimiter>Beneath the bridal crown, head lowered,<delimiter>And, as her fiery eyes she dips,<delimiter>A smile alights upon her lips.
<h1>XI</h1>
Alas, poor Lensky! In the kingdom<delimiter>Of distant, dark eternity,<delimiter>Was he perturbed by vows reneged on,<delimiter>Reports of infidelity,<delimiter>Or, on the Lethe, lulled to slumber,<delimiter>Where, blessedly, no thoughts encumber,<delimiter>The poet is no more perturbed,<delimiter>The earth is closed and no more heard?<delimiter>Just so! An earth that will ignore us<delimiter>Awaits us all beyond the grave.<delimiter>The voice of lover, friend or knave<delimiter>Breaks off. Alone, the angry chorus<delimiter>Of heirs to the estate is raised,<delimiter>Disputing in indecent haste.
<h1>XII</h1>
Soon Olya’s voice no more resounded<delimiter>Inside her old environment,<delimiter>The lancer, as his lot demanded,<delimiter>Must take her to his regiment.<delimiter>With tears of bitter sorrow flowing,<delimiter>The mother at her daughter’s going<delimiter>Seemed almost ready now to die,<delimiter>But Tanya simply could not cry,<delimiter>Only a deathly pallor covered<delimiter>The maiden’s melancholy face.<delimiter>When all came out to view the chaise<delimiter>And, bustling, said goodbye and hovered,<delimiter>Still holding back the newly wed,<delimiter>Tatiana wished the pair God speed.
<h1>XIII</h1>
And after them, outside the manor,<delimiter>Long did she gaze as through a mist…<delimiter>Alone, alone now is Tatiana!<delimiter>Alas, her sister, whom she missed,<delimiter>Companion of so many seasons,<delimiter>Her youthful little dove now hastens<delimiter>To somewhere far off, borne by fate,<delimiter>From her for ever separate;<delimiter>And, like a shade, she wanders, goalless,<delimiter>Glances into the garden bare…<delimiter>She finds no comforts anywhere<delimiter>Nor anything to give her solace<delimiter>For all the tears she has suppressed,<delimiter>And torn asunder is her breast.
<h1>XIV</h1>
And in her cruel isolation<delimiter>She feels more strongly passion’s sway,<delimiter>Her heart with greater perturbation<delimiter>Speaks of Onegin far away.<delimiter>She will not see him, maybe never,<delimiter>She should abhor in him for ever<delimiter>The slayer of her brother. Woe,<delimiter>The poet’s dead… already, though,<delimiter>He is forgot, his bride has given<delimiter>Herself already to be wed,<delimiter>The poet’s memory has fled<delimiter>As smoke across an azure heaven,<delimiter>There are two hearts yet, I believe,<delimiter>That grieve for him… but wherefore grieve?
<h1>XV</h1>
Evening arrived. The sky has darkened.<delimiter>The beetle whirrs. The waters flow.<delimiter>Gone are the choirs to which we hearkened;<delimiter>Across the river, smoking, glow<delimiter>The fires of fishermen; and, dreaming<delimiter>Under the silver moonlight streaming,<delimiter>Out in the country, on her own,<delimiter>Tatiana walks, walks on and on,<delimiter>When suddenly, and with a quiver,<delimiter>Below her, from her hill, she sees<delimiter>A manor house, a village, trees,<delimiter>A garden by a limpid river.<delimiter>She gazes — and the heart in her<delimiter>Starts beating fast and oftener.
<h1>XVI</h1>
She pauses now as doubts beset her:<delimiter>Should she continue, does she dare?<delimiter>He isn’t here. They’ve never met her…<delimiter>‘Oh, just the house — and garden there.<delimiter>I’ll peep at them,’ she says, advancing<delimiter>Downhill, scarce breathing, round her glancing,<delimiter>Bewildered as the house draws close…<delimiter>And to the empty courtyard goes.<delimiter>Dogs, barking, hurtle out toward her<delimiter>And, hearing her alarming cry,<delimiter>A noisy crowd of serf boys fly<delimiter>From different entrances to guard her,<delimiter>And, after fighting off each hound,<delimiter>They leave the lady safe and sound.
<h1>XVII</h1>
‘Please, can I see the house?’ asked Tanya.<delimiter>The children ran off speedily<delimiter>To find the keeper of the manor<delimiter>Who had with her the hallway key.<delimiter>Anisya promptly came to meet her,<delimiter>To open up the house and greet her.<delimiter>She entered the deserted pile,<delimiter>Our hero’s recent domicile,<delimiter>She looked: inside the hall, unheeded,<delimiter>A cue lay on the billiard baize,<delimiter>A riding crop upon a chaise<delimiter>Dishevelled. She proceeded.<delimiter>Here is the fireplace,’ said the crone:<delimiter>‘Here master used to sit alone.
<h1>XVIII</h1>
‘He used to dine here in the winter<delimiter>With neighbour Lensky, now deceased.<delimiter>This way, I’ll lead you. Here, we enter<delimiter>The master’s study, where he pleased<delimiter>To sleep, take coffee, pay attention<delimiter>To what the steward had to mention,<delimiter>And read a book the morning through…<delimiter>And the old master lived here, too.<delimiter>Time was, on Sundays, by this casement,<delimiter>He’d don his glasses and agree<delimiter>To play “tomfoolery” with me.<delimiter>God save his soul, he was so patient,<delimiter>And give his bones a peaceful berth<delimiter>In his damp grave in mother-earth.’
<h1>XIX</h1>
With melting gaze Tatiana measures<delimiter>The objects that surround her here,<delimiter>All seem to her like priceless treasures,<delimiter>All set her languid soul astir<delimiter>With feelings joyful and half-anguished:<delimiter>The desk, the lamp there, now extinguished,<delimiter>The carpet-covered bed, the books,<delimiter>The window over them that looks<delimiter>Out on the moonlit dark unending,<delimiter>And that pale half-light over all,<delimiter>Lord Byron’s portrait on the wall,<delimiter>And, on a little column standing,<delimiter>Arms crossed, a cast-iron statuette<delimiter>With gloomy forehead and a hat.
<h1>XX</h1>
Tatiana long as in a vision<delimiter>Stands in this fashionable cell.<delimiter>But it is late. A cold wind’s risen.<delimiter>The valley’s dark. The grove is still<delimiter>Above the mist-enveloped river;<delimiter>The moon behind the hill takes cover<delimiter>And it is time, indeed high time<delimiter>The pilgrim makes her homeward climb.<delimiter>And Tanya, hiding her excitement,<delimiter>Stifles a sigh before she starts<delimiter>Out back to more familiar parts.<delimiter>But first she asks whether she mightn’t<delimiter>Visit again the empty home<delimiter>And read the books there on her own.
<h1>XXI</h1>
Tatiana and Anisya parted,<delimiter>Beyond the gate. After two days —<delimiter>In early morning now — she started<delimiter>Towards that strange, deserted place.<delimiter>And, in the study’s silent setting,<delimiter>Briefly the earth entire forgetting,<delimiter>She was at last alone and free,<delimiter>And wept a long time, copiously.<delimiter>The books then called for her attention.<delimiter>At first, she lacked the appetite,<delimiter>But all the titles within sight<delimiter>Appeared bizarre. With apprehension<delimiter>She avidly began to read<delimiter>And found a different world indeed.
<h1>XXII</h1>
Although, as we’re aware, Onegin<delimiter>Had long abandoned reading, still<delimiter>There were some books he’d not forsaken<delimiter>That earned a place in his goodwill:<delimiter>The bard of Juan and the Giaour<delimiter>And two, three novels of the hour,<delimiter>In which the epoch was displayed<delimiter>And modern man put on parade<delimiter>And fairly faithfully depicted:<delimiter>With his depraved, immoral soul,<delimiter>Dried up and egotistical,<delimiter>To dreaming endlessly addicted,<delimiter>With his embittered, seething mind<delimiter>To futile enterprise consigned.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
There were preserved on many pages<delimiter>The trenchant mark of fingernails,<delimiter>With them the watchful girl engages<delimiter>As if she were deciphering spells.<delimiter>Tatiana saw with trepidation<delimiter>What thought it was or observation<delimiter>Had struck Onegin, what they meant,<delimiter>To which he’d given mute consent.<delimiter>And in the margins she encountered<delimiter>His pencil marks by certain lines.<delimiter>Throughout, his soul was by such signs,<delimiter>Without his knowing it, expounded,<delimiter>Whether by cross, by succinct word,<delimiter>Or question mark, as they occurred.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
And gradually my Tatiana<delimiter>Begins to understand — thank God! —<delimiter>More clearly now the true persona<delimiter>To sigh for whom it is her lot,<delimiter>By fate united to this stranger:<delimiter>Eccentric, sad, exuding danger,<delimiter>Creature of heaven or of hell,<delimiter>This angel, this proud devil — well,<delimiter>What is he then? An imitation,<delimiter>A paltry phantom or a joke,<delimiter>A Muscovite in Harold’s cloak,<delimiter>Of alien fads an explication,<delimiter>Of modish words a lexicon,<delimiter>A parody, when said and done?
<h1>XXV</h1>
Can she have solved Onegin’s puzzle?<delimiter>Can she have found the fitting ‘word’?<delimiter>The hours race on and in her tussle<delimiter>Her journey home is long deferred.<delimiter>Two neighbours there have met to chatter<delimiter>About her.’Well then, what’s the matter?’<delimiter>‘She is no child now, if you please,’<delimiter>Said the old lady with a wheeze.<delimiter>‘Why, Olen’ka is younger than her.’<delimiter>‘It’s time that she was settled, yes,<delimiter>But I feel helpless, I confess.<delimiter>In such a curt and point-blank manner<delimiter>She turns down everyone. And broods,<delimiter>And wanders lonely in the woods.’
<h1>XXVI</h1>
‘Might she not be in love?’ ‘With whom, then?’<delimiter>‘Buyanov courted her — no fear.<delimiter>And Petushkov — she left the room then.<delimiter>A guest, hussar Pykhtin, was here,<delimiter>And he found Tanya such a marvel,<delimiter>Pursued her like the very devil!<delimiter>I thought perhaps she’ll take this one,<delimiter>But no, once more the deal’s undone.’<delimiter>‘My dear good woman, why not send her<delimiter>To Moscow, to the bridal fair!<delimiter>So many vacant places there.’<delimiter>‘Good sir, my income’s much too slender.’<delimiter>‘Enough, though, for a winter’s spree,<delimiter>If not, then borrow — say, from me.’
<h1>XXVII</h1>
The ageing lady was delighted<delimiter>To hear this sensible advice;<delimiter>She pondered — and at once decided<delimiter>One winter would be worth the price.<delimiter>And Tanya learns of her intention.<delimiter>Unto the stringent monde’s attention<delimiter>To offer up the clarity<delimiter>Of countryside simplicity,<delimiter>Its dated finery and dresses<delimiter>And no less dated turns of phrase,<delimiter>Sure to attract the mocking gaze<delimiter>Of Moscow’s popinjays and Circes!<delimiter>God, no! Much better to remain<delimiter>Secluded in the wood’s domain.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
Arising as the sun is dawning,<delimiter>She hastens out; with melting eyes<delimiter>Surveys the fields, and speaks in mourning<delimiter>These words to all her rural ties:<delimiter>‘Farewell now, peaceful dales, farewell to<delimiter>Familiar hilltops that I call to,<delimiter>Farewell, familiar woods near by;<delimiter>Farewell, the beauty of the sky,<delimiter>Farewell, glad nature that I cherish;<delimiter>I am exchanging my dear peace<delimiter>For noisy, glittering vanities…<delimiter>Farewell, my freedom that must perish!<delimiter>Whither and wherefore do I strive?<delimiter>What can I hope for in this life?’
<h1>XXIX</h1>
Her walks continue, lasting longer.<delimiter>Now at a hillock, now a stream<delimiter>Tatiana cannot help but linger,<delimiter>Arrested by their special charm.<delimiter>As with old friends Tatiana hastens<delimiter>To carry on her conversations<delimiter>With every meadow, grove in sight,<delimiter>But short-lived summer’s taking flight.<delimiter>And golden autumn is arriving.<delimiter>Nature, now pale and tremulous,<delimiter>Is richly dressed for sacrifice.<delimiter>Here is the North now, storm clouds driving,<delimiter>It blows, it howls — and winter then,<delimiter>The sorceress arrives again.
<h1>XXX</h1>
She’s come, herself she scatters, weighting<delimiter>The oaken boughs with flocks of snow;<delimiter>Lies down in carpets undulating<delimiter>Over the hills and fields below;<delimiter>Spreads out a puffy shroud to cover<delimiter>The trace of banks and frozen river;<delimiter>Frost gleams. And we take pleasure in<delimiter>Old Mother Winter’s frolicking.<delimiter>But Tanya finds her antics galling.<delimiter>She shuns the winter, cannot bear<delimiter>To take a breath of frosty air,<delimiter>Or at the bath with new snow falling<delimiter>To wash her face, her shoulders, breast.<delimiter>Tatiana dreads this winter’s quest.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
Departure has been long extended,<delimiter>The final date is almost gone.<delimiter>The coach has been inspected, mended,<delimiter>Recovered from oblivion.<delimiter>The usual three kibitkas manage<delimiter>The plethora of goods and baggage:<delimiter>Pans, jars of jam, and chairs and chests<delimiter>And feather beds and mattresses,<delimiter>Roosters in cages, pots and basins,<delimiter>Etcetera — for so much more<delimiter>Is wrested from the family store.<delimiter>And in the log hut, losing patience<delimiter>The servants weep, farewell is hard:<delimiter>And eighteen nags invade the yard.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
They’re harnessed to the master carriage,<delimiter>The cooks prepare a lunch for all,<delimiter>The three kibitkas teem with baggage,<delimiter>While household women, coachmen brawl.<delimiter>A bearded outrider is seated<delimiter>Upon a jade, unkempt, depleted.<delimiter>Up at the gate retainers vie<delimiter>To bid their mistresses goodbye.<delimiter>The venerable carriage, gliding,<delimiter>Has crept beyond the gate. ‘Farewell,<delimiter>You peaceful places, hill and dell!<delimiter>Farewell the refuge that I’d hide in!<delimiter>When shall I see you all?’ she cries,<delimiter>And tears stream out of Tanya’s eyes.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
When we are free of the constrictions<delimiter>Of our benign enlightenment,<delimiter>In time (we’re told, from the predictions<delimiter>Of philosophic measurement,<delimiter>In some five hundred years) our highways<delimiter>Will no more look like tawdry byways,<delimiter>But surfaced roads on every hand<delimiter>Will unify the Russian land,<delimiter>And cast-iron bridges will support us<delimiter>On wide arcs over waterways,<delimiter>We’ll part the mountains in the skies,<delimiter>Dig daring tunnels under waters,<delimiter>And Christendom will institute<delimiter>A chain of inns on every route.
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
But now our roadways are decaying,<delimiter>Our bridges, now forgotten, rot,<delimiter>At stations fleas and bedbugs preying<delimiter>Won’t let a traveller sleep a jot.<delimiter>There are no inns. In some cold cabin<delimiter>There hangs for show a highfalutin’<delimiter>And meagre menu to excite<delimiter>An unrewarded appetite;<delimiter>While rural Cyclopes take courage<delimiter>Before a fire of little heat,<delimiter>And with a Russian hammer treat<delimiter>A slender European carriage,<delimiter>And bless the ditches and the moats<delimiter>That constitute our country’s roads.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
Yet in the chilly winter season<delimiter>A drive is light and pleasant. Like<delimiter>A voguish song devoid of reason,<delimiter>Unruffled is the winter track.<delimiter>We have automedons, quick-witted,<delimiter>And troikas tireless and intrepid,<delimiter>And mileposts, like a fence, race by,<delimiter>Diverting the lethargic eye.<delimiter>But Larina drove none too fleetly,<delimiter>Her transport all her own for fear<delimiter>Post-chaises would have proved too dear,<delimiter>And our young maid enjoyed completely<delimiter>The road’s monotonous delights:<delimiter>They travelled seven days and nights.
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
But they are close now, and their horses<delimiter>To white-stone Moscow gallop, as<delimiter>They glimpse ahead the golden crosses<delimiter>Glowing on ancient cupolas.<delimiter>Brothers, there’s nothing that can equal<delimiter>My pleasure when a semi-circle<delimiter>Of churches, belfries, gardens, halls<delimiter>Opened to me inside the walls.<delimiter>How often, sadly separated,<delimiter>Fated to roam without resort,<delimiter>Moscow, it was of you I thought!<delimiter>Moscow, whose name reverberated<delimiter>In every Russian heart! I heard<delimiter>So many echoes in that word!
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
Here next, by leafy grove surrounded,<delimiter>Petrovsky Castle stands. Dark pride<delimiter>In recent glory here resounded.<delimiter>Here Bonaparte chose to reside<delimiter>By Fortune’s smile intoxicated,<delimiter>He waited — but in vain he waited —<delimiter>For Moscow on her bended knees<delimiter>To yield to him old Kremlin’s keys.<delimiter>My Moscow spurned such self-abasement,<delimiter>No gift, no feast day she declared,<delimiter>A fiery welcome she prepared<delimiter>To greet a hero so impatient.<delimiter>From here he watched, in thought immersed,<delimiter>The dreadful conflagration burst.
<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
Farewell to you, Petrovsky Palace,<delimiter>Witness of glory’s first defeat,<delimiter>Away now to the turnpike pillars<delimiter>Whitening on Tverskaya Street.<delimiter>Across the pits the carriage flashes,<delimiter>Past sentries, peasant women dashes,<delimiter>Past street lamps, shops and errand boys,<delimiter>Past monasteries, gardens, sleighs,<delimiter>Mansions, Bokharans, small plantations,<delimiter>Shacks, merchants, peasants selling wares,<delimiter>Boulevards and Cossack messengers,<delimiter>Towers, pharmacies and stores with fashions,<delimiter>Balconies, gates where lions curl,<delimiter>Crosses where flocks of jackdaws swirl.
<h1>XXXIX. XL</h1>
An hour or two they go on driving<delimiter>In this exhausting marathon,<delimiter>When at a gated house arriving,<delimiter>They stop — just by St Khariton<delimiter>To see an aunt, who, with consumption<delimiter>Some four years now, can hardly function.<delimiter>To them the door is opened wide,<delimiter>A grey-haired Kalmyk stands inside,<delimiter>Arrayed in torn kaftan and glasses,<delimiter>And with a stocking in his hand.<delimiter>In the salon, from her divan,<delimiter>The cry they hear is the Princess’s.<delimiter>The two old ladies weep, embrace<delimiter>And exclamations pour apace.
<h1>XLI</h1>
‘Princesse, mon ange!’ ‘Pachette!’ ‘Dear cousin<delimiter>Alina!’ ‘Who’d have thought? It’s been<delimiter>So long. You’ll stay? Well, stop this fussing,<delimiter>Sit down — how wonderful, a scene<delimiter>Out of a novel, just the manner.’<delimiter>‘But meet my daughter here, Tatiana.’<delimiter>‘Ah Tanya, come to me, my dear…<delimiter>I’m getting quite deranged, I fear…<delimiter>Our Grandison, do you remember?’<delimiter>‘What Grandison? Oh, Grandison!<delimiter>Of course, I wonder where he’s gone?’<delimiter>‘Lives near St Simeon’s; last December,<delimiter>On Christmas Eve he called on me:<delimiter>Married a son quite recently.
<h1>XLII</h1>
‘The other one — a little patience…<delimiter>Tomorrow, Tanya we shall show<delimiter>To all her various relations.<delimiter>Pity, I’m too infirm to go,<delimiter>I scarce can drag my feet, the devils,<delimiter>But you are weary from your travels;<delimiter>Together let us take a rest,<delimiter>Oh, I’ve no strength… my poor, tired chest…<delimiter>Not even joy, not only sorrow<delimiter>Is hard for me to bear, my dear.<delimiter>I’m good for nothing now, it’s clear.<delimiter>Life in old age is such a horror.’<delimiter>And, weeping, by exhaustion hit,<delimiter>She breaks into a coughing fit.
<h1>XLIII</h1>
Tatiana’s touched by the good-hearted<delimiter>Affection of the invalid,<delimiter>And yet she is unhappy, parted<delimiter>From her accustomed room and bed.<delimiter>Round her a silken curtain closes,<delimiter>Yet she can’t sleep, when she reposes,<delimiter>The church bells’ early roundelay,<delimiter>Precursor of the labouring day,<delimiter>Arouses her, and in the shadows<delimiter>She sits beside the window, sees<delimiter>The darkness thinning by degrees,<delimiter>But can’t discern her fields, her meadows,<delimiter>Before her lies a yard that’s strange,<delimiter>A stable, fence and kitchen range.
<h1>XLIV</h1>
To daily dinners Tanya’s taken<delimiter>With her extended family,<delimiter>But grandmas, grandpas cannot quicken<delimiter>The girl’s abstracted lethargy.<delimiter>Relatives from a far location<delimiter>Are welcomed with solicitation,<delimiter>With exclamations and good cheer.<delimiter>‘How Tanya’s grown! How long, my dear,<delimiter>Since at your christening I dried you,’<delimiter>‘And since I held you — all those years!’<delimiter>‘And since I pulled you by the ears!’<delimiter>‘And since with gingerbread I plied you!’<delimiter>And grandmothers in chorus cry:<delimiter>‘Oh how our years go flying by!’
<h1>XLV</h1>
But nothing changes in their bearing,<delimiter>Where age-old fashion is the rule;<delimiter>The princess Aunt Yelena’s wearing<delimiter>Her ancient mobcap made of tulle;<delimiter>Cerused still is Lukerya Lvovna,<delimiter>Still telling lies Lyubov Petrovna,<delimiter>Ivan Petrovich is inane,<delimiter>Semyon Petrovich just as mean;<delimiter>Still Pelageya Nikolavna<delimiter>Keeps Monsieur Finemouche in her house<delimiter>With Pomeranian dog and spouse.<delimiter>While he, the conscientious clubber,<delimiter>Is still the meek and deaf man who<delimiter>Consumes and drinks enough for two.
<h1>XLVI</h1>
Their daughters put their arms round Tanya.<delimiter>These graces of young Moscow now<delimiter>Without a word observe Tatiana,<delimiter>Surveying her from top to toe;<delimiter>They find her somewhat unexpected,<delimiter>Provincial and a touch affected,<delimiter>A little pale, a little thin,<delimiter>But passable for kith and kin;<delimiter>And then, to nature’s way submitting,<delimiter>They take her to their rooms, make friends,<delimiter>And kiss her, gently squeezing hands,<delimiter>Fluff up her curls to look more fitting,<delimiter>And in their singsong tones impart<delimiter>Maids’ secrets, secrets of the heart,
<h1>XLVII</h1>
Conquests, their own and those of others,<delimiter>Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries.<delimiter>Their guileless conversation gathers,<delimiter>Embellished by slight calumnies,<delimiter>Then, to requite their indiscretion,<delimiter>They sweetly ask for her confession<delimiter>Of secrets of the heart she keeps.<delimiter>But Tanya, just as if she sleeps,<delimiter>Is hearing them without partaking,<delimiter>And, understanding nothing, she<delimiter>Protects her secret silently,<delimiter>Her heart’s fond treasure, blissful, aching,<delimiter>The tears and joys she will not share<delimiter>With anyone encountered there.

Tatiana seeks to be convivial,<delimiter>To listen to what people say,<delimiter>But in the drawing-room such trivial<delimiter>And incoherent rot holds sway;<delimiter>The people are so pale and weary,<delimiter>Their very slander’s dull and dreary.<delimiter>Within this land of sterile views,<delimiter>Interrogations, gossip, news,<delimiter>Through four-and-twenty hours you’ll never<delimiter>Spot one lone thought, even by chance;<delimiter>A languid mind won’t smile or dance,<delimiter>Even in jest the heart won’t quiver.<delimiter>We might to foolish jokes respond,<delimiter>If you but knew some, hollow monde!
<h1>XLIX</h1>
The archive boys in congregation<delimiter>Cast eyes on Tanya priggishly<delimiter>And speak of her with denigration<delimiter>In one another’s company.<delimiter>But there’s one coxcomb in dejection<delimiter>For whom she seems ideal perfection,<delimiter>And, leaning on a doorpost, he<delimiter>Prepares for her an elegy.<delimiter>Once, Vyazemsky, on meeting Tanya<delimiter>At some dull aunt’s, sat by the girl<delimiter>And managed to engage her soul,<delimiter>And near him, an old man, who’d seen her,<delimiter>Straightening out his wig, inquired<delimiter>After this maiden he admired.
<h1>L</h1>
But where Melpomene is uttering<delimiter>Her loud, protracted wails, laments<delimiter>And, with her gaudy mantle fluttering,<delimiter>Confronts a frigid audience,<delimiter>Where Thalia is quietly napping,<delimiter>Hearkening not to friendly clapping,<delimiter>Where to Terpsichore alone<delimiter>he young spectator now is drawn<delimiter>(As was the case in years departed,<delimiter>In your day and in mine the same),<delimiter>At whom no jealous ladies aim<delimiter>Lorgnettes when once the ballet’s started.<delimiter>Nor modish experts train a glass,<delimiter>From box or stall, to judge her class.
<h1>LI</h1>
To the Assembly, too, they bring her,<delimiter>Where the excitement, crush and heat,<delimiter>The tapers’ glare, the music’s clangour,<delimiter>The flicker, whirl of dancing feet,<delimiter>The light attire of pretty women,<delimiter>The galleries with people brimming,<delimiter>The arc of seats for brides-to-be<delimiter>All strike the senses suddenly.<delimiter>Here are inveterate fops, parading<delimiter>Their waistcoats and impertinence,<delimiter>And nonchalantly held lorgnettes.<delimiter>Here are hussars on leave, invading,<delimiter>Who, thundering through in great display,<delimiter>Flash, captivate and fly away.
<h1>LII</h1>
The night has many starry clusters,<delimiter>And Moscow pretty women, too,<delimiter>But, brighter far than all her sisters,<delimiter>The moon shines in the airy blue.<delimiter>But she — my lyre dares not disquiet her<delimiter>With songs, I fear, that won’t delight her —<delimiter>Shines like the regal moon alone<delimiter>‘Midst maids and ladies round her throne.<delimiter>With what celestial pride she graces<delimiter>The earth which by her is caressed,<delimiter>What blissful feelings fill her breast,<delimiter>How wondrous-languidly she gazes!…<delimiter>But stop, enough, I beg of you,<delimiter>To folly now you’ve paid your due.
<h1>LIII</h1>
Noise, laughter, galop, waltz, mazurka,<delimiter>Bows, bustle… meanwhile from the dance<delimiter>Tatiana hides — the capers irk her —<delimiter>Beside a column, ‘twixt two aunts,<delimiter>She looks but does not see, detesting<delimiter>The worldly tumult and the jesting,<delimiter>She, stifling here, in fancy strains<delimiter>To reach again her fields and lanes,<delimiter>Her rural life: the tranquil bowers,<delimiter>The poor folk, the secluded nook<delimiter>Where flows a tiny, limpid brook,<delimiter>Her novels and the country flowers,<delimiter>And those tenebrous linden ways<delimiter>Where he appeared in former days.
<h1>LIV</h1>
But while her mind is in the distance,<delimiter>Forgetting monde and noisy ball,<delimiter>A certain general of substance<delimiter>Won’t take his eyes off her at all.<delimiter>The two aunts wink and in like manner<delimiter>Both with their elbows nudge Tatiana,<delimiter>And each one whispers in her ear:<delimiter>‘Look quickly to the left, my dear.’<delimiter>‘The left? But where? What is so special?’<delimiter>‘Well, never mind what it may be,<delimiter>Just look… that group… in front, you see…<delimiter>Those two in uniform, official…<delimiter>Gone… Wait, his profile’s in between.’<delimiter>‘Who? That fat general, you mean?’
<h1>LV</h1>
But let’s extend congratulations<delimiter>To dear Tatiana, triumphing,<delimiter>And change my course (entreating patience),<delimiter>Lest I forget of whom I sing.<delimiter>And by the way two words, updating:<delimiter>‘I sing a youthful friend, relating<delimiter>His many eccentricities.<delimiter>Please favour the felicities,<delimiter>O epic Muse, of my exertions,<delimiter>And, with your trusty staff, let me<delimiter>Not wander on so waywardly.’<delimiter>There, done! Enough! No more diversions!<delimiter>Thus, classicism I placate:<delimiter>An Introduction’s here, though late.
<h1>Chapter VIII</h1>
<i>Fare thee well, and, if for ever.<delimiter>Still forever fare thee well.</i><delimiter>Byron
<h1>I</h1>
In those far days, serene and careless,<delimiter>The lycée’s gardens saw me grow,<delimiter>I read with pleasure Apuleius<delimiter>And disregarded Cicero,<delimiter>In those far days, in dales mysterious,<delimiter>In spring, when swans call out, imperious,<delimiter>Near waters shining tranquilly,<delimiter>The Muse began to visit me.<delimiter>My student cell was inundated<delimiter>With sudden light. She brought me there<delimiter>A youthful feast, a merry fare<delimiter>Of fancies that in song she fêted,<delimiter>Sang, too, our glorious, ancient themes,<delimiter>Sang of the heart that stirs our dreams.
<h1>II</h1>
And with a smile my Muse was greeted;<delimiter>Our first success encouraged us,<delimiter>We were by old Derzhavin heeded<delimiter>And blessed before he joined the dust…
<h1>III</h1>
And I, who make the rule of passions<delimiter>The only law I recognize,<delimiter>Sharing my feelings with the fashions,<delimiter>I led my frisky Muse to prize<delimiter>The noise of feasts and fierce discussions,<delimiter>Of watch-endangering excursions;<delimiter>And to these crazy feasts she brought<delimiter>Her native gifts, began to sport<delimiter>And gambol like a young bacchante,<delimiter>And, over cups, to guests she’d sing,<delimiter>And in a youthful gathering<delimiter>Among the men she’d be the centre,<delimiter>And in that amicable crowd,<delimiter>My giddy mistress made me proud.
<h1>IV</h1>
But I seceded from their union<delimiter>And fled afar… she followed me.<delimiter>How often would she, fond companion,<delimiter>Sweeten my mute trajectory<delimiter>With secret tales and magic aura!<delimiter>How often, moonlit, like Leonora,<delimiter>She d gallop with me on a horse<delimiter>Across the crags of Caucasus!<delimiter>How often on the shores of Tauris<delimiter>She led me in nocturnal gloom<delimiter>To listen to the sea’s dull boom,<delimiter>The Nereids unceasing chorus,<delimiter>The waves profound, eternal choir<delimiter>And hymn of praise to heaven’s sire.
<h1>V</h1>
And then a change in her behaviour:<delimiter>Forgetting feasts and opulence,<delimiter>Amid the wastes of sad Moldavia<delimiter>She visited the humble tents<delimiter>Of wandering tribes, and, living with them,<delimiter>Grew wild and shared their daily rhythm,<delimiter>Forgetting her Olympian speech<delimiter>For strange, scant tongues the tribesmen teach,<delimiter>For steppe-land song she found appealing…<delimiter>Then suddenly this picture cleared<delimiter>And in my garden she appeared<delimiter>As a provincial miss, revealing<delimiter>A thoughtful sadness in her look<delimiter>And in her hands a small, French book.
<h1>VI</h1>
And, for the first time now, I’m taking<delimiter>My Muse to join a worldly rout;<delimiter>With jealous apprehension quaking,<delimiter>I view the steppe-land charms she’s brought.<delimiter>Through solid rows aristocratic,<delimiter>Of army fops, corps diplomatic<delimiter>And past imperious dames she flits.<delimiter>Now, looking quietly, she sits,<delimiter>The noisy multitude admiring,<delimiter>The flickering of dress and speech,<delimiter>The guests who slowly try to reach<delimiter>The young hostess, who waits untiring,<delimiter>The men, who, like dark picture frames,<delimiter>Surround the women and the dames.
<h1>VII</h1>
She liked the hieratic order<delimiter>Of oligarchic colloquies,<delimiter>The chill of tranquil pride that awed her,<delimiter>And ranks and years that mixed at ease.<delimiter>But who in this august collection<delimiter>Stands silently, with disaffection?<delimiter>Not one of them appears to know.<delimiter>Before him, faces come and go<delimiter>Like ghosts in tedious succession.<delimiter>What does his face show — spleen, hurt pride?<delimiter>Why is this person at our side?<delimiter>Who is he? Well, it’s my impression<delimiter>He’s Eugene. Really? Yes, it’s clear.<delimiter>What wind is it that’s blown him here?
<h1>VIII</h1>
Is he the same or more pacific?<delimiter>Has he returned in novel style?<delimiter>Or does he still play the eccentric?<delimiter>What will he stage for us meanwhile?<delimiter>As what will he appear now? Melmoth?<delimiter>A cosmopolitan, a patriot,<delimiter>A Harold, Quaker, Pharisee<delimiter>Or else some other jeu d’esprit<delimiter>Or simply as a decent fellow,<delimiter>Like you and me and everyone?<delimiter>A fashion that is past and done<delimiter>I say you should not try to follow.<delimiter>We’ve had enough of all his show.<delimiter>‘You know him, then?’ ‘Well, yes and no.’
<h1>IX</h1>
‘Then tell me why you’re so begrudging,<delimiter>When talking of him. Might it be<delimiter>Because we never tire of judging<delimiter>The world around us ceaselessly,<delimiter>Because a rash and fiery spirit,<delimiter>To smug nonentities that near it,<delimiter>Seems insolent and out of place,<delimiter>And men of wit constrain your space?<delimiter>Because we’re wont to talk forever<delimiter>Instead of acting or because<delimiter>Stupidity wins our applause?<delimiter>Because grave men delight in trivia,<delimiter>And only mediocrity<delimiter>Will make us feel at liberty?’
<h1>X</h1>
Blest who in youth was truly youthful,<delimiter>Blest who matured in proper time,<delimiter>Who, step by step, remaining truthful,<delimiter>Could weather, yearly, life’s bleak clime,<delimiter>To curious dreams was not addicted,<delimiter>Nor by the social mob constricted,<delimiter>At twenty was a blade or swell<delimiter>And then at thirty married well;<delimiter>Ridding himself, on reaching fifty,<delimiter>Of debts and other bills to foot,<delimiter>Then calmly gaining rank, repute<delimiter>And money, too, by being thrifty;<delimiter>Of whom the world’s opinion ran:<delimiter>NN’s an estimable man.
<h1>XI</h1>
How sad, however, if we’re given<delimiter>Our youth as something to betray,<delimiter>And what if youth in turn is driven<delimiter>To cheat on us, each hour, each day,<delimiter>If our most precious aspirations,<delimiter>Our freshest dreams, imaginations<delimiter>In fast succession have decayed,<delimiter>As leaves, in putrid autumn, fade.<delimiter>It is too much to see before one<delimiter>Nothing but dinners in a row,<delimiter>Behind the seemly crowd to go,<delimiter>Regarding life as mere decorum,<delimiter>Having no common views to share,<delimiter>Nor passions that one might declare.
<h1>XII</h1>
When noisy comments start to plague you,<delimiter>You won’t endure it (you’ll agree),<delimiter>If people of good sense should take you<delimiter>For someone feigning oddity,<delimiter>A melancholy, crazed impostor<delimiter>Or maybe a satanic monster<delimiter>Or even my own Demon. Thus,<delimiter>Onegin once more busies us.<delimiter>He’d killed his friend; bereft of pleasure,<delimiter>He lived with neither work nor goal<delimiter>Till twenty-six, and still his soul<delimiter>Languished in unproductive leisure;<delimiter>He lacked employment and a wife<delimiter>And any purpose in his life.
<h1>XIII</h1>
A restless spirit took him over,<delimiter>A wish to travel, anywhere<delimiter>(An inclination like a fever<delimiter>Or cross that few will gladly bear).<delimiter>And so he came to the conclusion<delimiter>To leave the fields’ and woods’ seclusion,<delimiter>Where every day a bloodstained shade<delimiter>Appeared to him and would not fade,<delimiter>And sallied forth without direction,<delimiter>With one sensation in his mind;<delimiter>And, as with all he’d left behind,<delimiter>So travel, too fed his dejection.<delimiter>He found his way back after all,<delimiter>Like Chatsky, leaving boat for ball.
<h1>XIV</h1>
But look at how the crowd is clearing,<delimiter>How whispers speed around the hall…<delimiter>The hostess sees a lady nearing,<delimiter>In tow a weighty general.<delimiter>She is unhurried, not loquacious,<delimiter>Not cold, standoffish, not ungracious,<delimiter>She does not stare with insolence,<delimiter>And to success makes no pretence;<delimiter>Reveals no petty affectation<delimiter>Or imitative artifice,<delimiter>She shows a quiet, simple grace,<delimiter>And seems a faithful illustration<delimiter>Of comme il faut (a phrase which I,<delimiter>Shishkov forgive, can’t Russify).
<h1>XV</h1>
The ladies gathered closer to her;<delimiter>Old women smiled as she passed by,<delimiter>The gentlemen were bowing lower,<delimiter>Endeavouring to catch her eye.<delimiter>In front of her, the girls stopped chasing<delimiter>Across the room, while gravely raising<delimiter>Shoulders and nose above them all,<delimiter>The general impressed the hall.<delimiter>None could have said she was a beauty,<delimiter>Nevertheless, from head to foot,<delimiter>None could have found in her what would,<delimiter>In fashionable London city,<delimiter>In that high autocratic court,<delimiter>Be known as vulgar (I can not…
<h1>XVI</h1>
I’ m very fond of this expression,<delimiter>But own, I can’t translate it yet,<delimiter>It still feels like an innovation<delimiter>And hardly suits our etiquette;<delimiter>An epigram might serve it better…)<delimiter>But let me turn now to our matter.<delimiter>With carefree charm, our lady sat,<delimiter>Engaged in amicable chat<delimiter>With Nina Voronskoy, at table,<delimiter>The Cleopatra of Neva,<delimiter>Who, though more beautiful by far,<delimiter>With classic features, smooth like marble,<delimiter>Could not eclipse her fellow guest,<delimiter>For all the dazzle she possessed.
<h1>XVII</h1>
‘Can it be possible?’ thinks Eugene<delimiter>‘Can it be she? But no… and yet…<delimiter>What! From the steppes, that outback region…?’<delimiter>He keeps his resolute lorgnette<delimiter>Directed at her every minute<delimiter>And dimly sees, reflected in it,<delimiter>Looks he’d forgotten long ago.<delimiter>‘Excuse me, Prince, but do you know<delimiter>That lady in the crimson beret<delimiter>Talking with Spain’s ambassador?’<delimiter>The Prince looks at Onegin: ‘Ah!<delimiter>You’ve been away a long time — very,<delimiter>Wait, I’ll present you, when they end.’<delimiter>‘But who is she?’ ‘My wife, dear friend.’
<h1>XVIII</h1>
‘You’re married.’ ‘Oh, you did not know then?’<delimiter>‘How long?’ ‘About two years.’ ‘To whom?’<delimiter>‘To Larina.’ ‘Tatiana!’ ‘Oh then,<delimiter>She knows you.’ ‘I live near her home.’<delimiter>‘In that case, come,’the Prince says, taking<delimiter>His relative and friend, Onegin,<delimiter>To meet his wife. The Princess looks<delimiter>At him… and whatsoever shakes<delimiter>Her soul, whatever her impression<delimiter>Of him or the astonishment<delimiter>She feels or the bewilderment,<delimiter>Nothing betrays her self-possession.<delimiter>Her tone remains as it had been,<delimiter>Her bow is equally serene.
<h1>XIX</h1>
Not only did she not take flight now,<delimiter>Or suddenly turn crimson, white…<delimiter>She never even moved an eyebrow,<delimiter>Nor pursed her lips a bit too tight.<delimiter>Although Onegin looked most closely,<delimiter>He found no trace in her that loosely<delimiter>Recalled the girl that he had met.<delimiter>He wanted to address her… yet<delimiter>He could not… She then spoke, inquiring<delimiter>How long had he been here, and whence,<delimiter>And was it from their parts perchance;<delimiter>Then to her husband turned, retiring.<delimiter>With weary look she glided hence…<delimiter>Eugene remained there, motionless.
<h1>XX</h1>
Could it be she, the same Tatiana,<delimiter>The very maiden he once met<delimiter>In that remote and distant corner<delimiter>And preached to in a tête-à-tête<delimiter>With loftiness and exhortation,<delimiter>When we embarked on our narration,<delimiter>Was hers the letter he’d preserved,<delimiter>In which her heart spoke, unreserved,<delimiter>Out in the open, undeflected,<delimiter>That little girl… a dream, maybe?<delimiter>That little girl… the one whom he<delimiter>Had, in her humble lot, neglected,<delimiter>Could it be she who, now so bold,<delimiter>Had, heedless, left him in the cold?
<h1>XXI</h1>
He leaves the packed hall hurriedly<delimiter>And pensively he drives back home,<delimiter>His tardy sleep is worried by<delimiter>A dream, now sad, now full of charm,<delimiter>He wakes; an invitation’s brought;<delimiter>His presence by Prince N is sought<delimiter>At a soirée. ‘My God, to her!<delimiter>I will, I will, without demur!<delimiter>He scrawls a courteous ‘Yes, I’ll be there.’<delimiter>What’s happening? In what strange dream<delimiter>Is he now? What, deep down in him,<delimiter>Has stirred his sluggish soul to fever?<delimiter>Pique? Vanity? Or, once again,<delimiter>Could it be love, that youthful pain?
<h1>XXII</h1>
The passing hours Onegin’s counting,<delimiter>For day to end he cannot wait.<delimiter>But ten strikes, he’s already mounting<delimiter>His carriage, soon he’s at the gate.<delimiter>He enters in a nervous manner,<delimiter>There, on her own, he finds Tatiana,<delimiter>Some minutes they together sit.<delimiter>Once more Onegin cannot fit<delimiter>A word in place. Embarrassed, sullen,<delimiter>He scarcely can reply to her.<delimiter>But all the time his mind’s a-whirr.<delimiter>A fixed idea he keeps on mulling.<delimiter>And fixedly he looks, while she<delimiter>Sits calmly and at liberty.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
Her husband enters, interrupting<delimiter>This most unpleasant tête-à-tête,<delimiter>And joins Onegin in recapturing<delimiter>Pranks, jokes enjoyed, when first they met.<delimiter>They laugh together. Guests now enter<delimiter>And with the large-grained salt of banter<delimiter>The grand monde’s conversation sparks;<delimiter>Around the hostess, light remarks<delimiter>Are flashing without affectation.<delimiter>While, interrupting them, good sense<delimiter>Eschews banality, pretence,<delimiter>Eternal truths, pontification,<delimiter>And, in its free vivacity,<delimiter>Shocks nobody’s propriety.
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Yet here was found the city’s flower:<delimiter>Nobles and fashion’s exemplars,<delimiter>Faces one meets with every hour,<delimiter>And fools — a necessary class;<delimiter>Here were, in mobcaps and in roses,<delimiter>Elderly dames who looked ferocious;<delimiter>Here there were several spinsters, who<delimiter>Would never think to smile at you;<delimiter>Here an ambassador was speaking<delimiter>About some government affair;<delimiter>Here was, with scented, greying hair,<delimiter>An old man in the old way joking:<delimiter>With first-rate wit and subtle play,<delimiter>That seem somewhat absurd today.
<h1>XXV</h1>
Here was, to epigrams addicted,<delimiter>An irritable gentleman,<delimiter>Cross with the tea — too sweet a liquid —<delimiter>With trivial ladies, vulgar men,<delimiter>The foggy novel being debated,<delimiter>The badge of which two sisters prated,<delimiter>The lies the journals told, the war,<delimiter>The snow, and wife he found a bore<delimiter>…………………………………………<delimiter>…………………………………………<delimiter>…………………………………………<delimiter>…………………………………………<delimiter>…………………………………………<delimiter>…………………………………………
<h1>XXVI</h1>
Here was Prolasov whose distinction<delimiter>Lay in his soul’s depravity,<delimiter>In every album you can mention<delimiter>He wore your pencils down, Saint-Priest;<delimiter>There at the door a ball dictator,<delimiter>Fit for a fashion illustrator,<delimiter>Pink as a Palm Week cherub, shone,<delimiter>Tight-buttoned, mute and still as stone;<delimiter>A jackanapes, a bird of passage,<delimiter>With neck-cloth overstarched, produced<delimiter>A smile among the guests, seduced<delimiter>By his fastidious poise and carriage,<delimiter>But silent glances in the end<delimiter>Confirmed he was by all condemned.
<h1>XXVII</h1>
Throughout the evening my Onegin<delimiter>Thought only of Tatiana, not<delimiter>The shy young girl that he’d forsaken,<delimiter>Simple and poor, by love distraught,<delimiter>But the princess, so very different,<delimiter>Now the goddess, so very distant,<delimiter>Ruling the opulent Neva.<delimiter>O humans! You’re so similar<delimiter>To Eve, our ancestress: what’s granted<delimiter>Does not appeal to you at all,<delimiter>You hear the serpent’s endless call<delimiter>To where a secret tree is planted;<delimiter>Forbidden fruit provides more spice,<delimiter>Without it there’s no paradise.
<h1>XXVIII</h1>
How changed Tatiana is, adapting<delimiter>So resolutely to her role,<delimiter>With what alacrity accepting<delimiter>The codes of rank that cramp the soul!<delimiter>Who’d dare to seek the tender creature<delimiter>In this majestic legislator<delimiter>Of every salon, one whose heart<delimiter>Had once by him been torn apart?<delimiter>Time was, when virginally grieving<delimiter>For Eugene in the dark of night,<delimiter>While Morpheus was still in flight,<delimiter>She raised her tired eyes moonward, dreaming<delimiter>Of how together they might wend<delimiter>Their humble journey to the end.
<h1>XXIX</h1>
Love is for every age auspicious,<delimiter>But for the virginal and young<delimiter>Its impulses are more propitious<delimiter>Like vernal storms on meadows sprung:<delimiter>They freshen in the rain of passion,<delimiter>Ripening in their renovation —<delimiter>And life, empowered, sends up shoots<delimiter>Of richest blooms and sweetest fruits.<delimiter>But at a late age, dry and fruitless,<delimiter>The final stage to which we’re led,<delimiter>Sad is the trace of passions dead:<delimiter>Thus storms in autumn, cold and ruthless,<delimiter>Transform the field into a slough,<delimiter>And strip the trees from root to bough.
<h1>XXX</h1>
There is no doubt, alas, that Eugene’s<delimiter>In love with Tanya like a child,<delimiter>And every day and night imagines,<delimiter>In throes of love, some fancy wild,<delimiter>Not harking to his mind’s stern censures,<delimiter>Each day up to her porch he ventures,<delimiter>Into her entrance hall of glass;<delimiter>He shadows her in every place;<delimiter>He’s happy if upon her shoulders<delimiter>He casts a fluffy boa, if he<delimiter>Touches her hand hot-bloodedly<delimiter>Or motley liveries, like soldiers,<delimiter>He separates before her or<delimiter>Her handkerchief picks from the floor.
<h1>XXXI</h1>
She does not mark, she does not heed him,<delimiter>Though he might struggle, short of death,<delimiter>To visit her she grants him freedom,<delimiter>Elsewhere she scarcely wastes her breath;<delimiter>Sometimes she’ll bow out of politeness,<delimiter>Sometimes she simply takes no notice.<delimiter>There is no coquetry in her —<delimiter>It is not brooked in her milieu.<delimiter>Onegin pales, can hardly function.<delimiter>She does not care or does not see.<delimiter>Onegin pines away, is he<delimiter>Already suffering from consumption?<delimiter>All send him to the doctors, they<delimiter>Prescribe a spa without delay.
<h1>XXXII</h1>
He stays: beforehand he’d been ready<delimiter>To warn his forebears to expect<delimiter>That soon he’d be among them, yet she<delimiter>Cares not a bit (such is their sex).<delimiter>But he is stubborn, won’t surrender,<delimiter>Still hopes and keeps to his agenda.<delimiter>Far bolder than a healthy man,<delimiter>Unwell, he writes with feeble hand<delimiter>The Princess an impassioned letter,<delimiter>Although (in this I share his views)<delimiter>He saw in letters little use;<delimiter>But with his heart held in a fetter,<delimiter>A missive could not be deferred.<delimiter>Here is his letter, word for word.<delimiter>Onegin’s Letter to Tatiana<delimiter>I can predict: I shall offend<delimiter>You with my secret, sad confession,<delimiter>And I foresee your proud expression<delimiter>Of bitter scorn for what I send.<delimiter>What do I want? To what end, after<delimiter>I’ve opened up my soul to you?<delimiter>What wicked merriment, what laughter<delimiter>I’ll give, perhaps, occasion to!<delimiter>When first I met you, I detected<delimiter>A tender spark, I was affected,<delimiter>But to the challenge dared not rise,<delimiter>I’d curbed myself of that sweet habit,<delimiter>And I had no desire to forfeit<delimiter>The hateful freedom I so prize.<delimiter>Yet one more thing drove us asunder…<delimiter>Lensky, a hapless victim, fell…<delimiter>And then, from all a heart finds tender<delimiter>I tore my own; an alien soul,<delimiter>Without allegiances, I vanished,<delimiter>Thinking that liberty and peace<delimiter>Could take the place of happiness.<delimiter>My God, how wrong, how I’ve been punished!<delimiter>To see you as each minute flies,<delimiter>To follow you in all directions,<delimiter>To capture with enamoured eyes<delimiter>Your smiling lips, your eyes’ reflections,<delimiter>To listen and to understand<delimiter>With all my soul your perfect nature,<delimiter>To melt in torments at your hand,<delimiter>Grow pale and waste away — that’s rapture!<delimiter>And I’m deprived of that: for you<delimiter>I drag myself at random, wander,<delimiter>Each day is dear, each hour too:<delimiter>Yet I in futile dullness squander<delimiter>The days my fate has counted off.<delimiter>And they are burdensome enough.<delimiter>I know: my end may well be dawning,<delimiter>But so as to prolong my stay,<delimiter>I must be certain every morning<delimiter>That I shall see you that same day…<delimiter>I fear that my meek supplication<delimiter>Will be by your relentless gaze<delimiter>Seen as a shameful machination —<delimiter>I hear your furious dispraise.<delimiter>If you but knew the frightful torment<delimiter>To languish after your beloved,<delimiter>To burn — while reason every moment<delimiter>Tells you to quell your raging blood,<delimiter>To wish to hold your knees, and, pouring<delimiter>My tears out at your feet, to press,<delimiter>Entreat, confess, reproach, imploring<delimiter>All, all I’ve wanted to express,<delimiter>To do so, feigning reservation,<delimiter>To arm each glance and every phrase,<delimiter>To look at you with cheerful gaze<delimiter>And hold a placid conversation…<delimiter>But let that be: I’m in no state<delimiter>To struggle further with my passion;<delimiter>My life depends on your decision<delimiter>And I surrender to my fate.
<h1>XXXIII</h1>
He gets no answer to this letter,<delimiter>A second and a third he sends,<delimiter>But neither one fares any better.<delimiter>At a reception he attends,<delimiter>He’s hardly entered than towards him<delimiter>Tatiana comes, and she ignores him,<delimiter>Says nothing, does not see him there.<delimiter>What frost surrounds her, how severe!<delimiter>How, holding back her indignation,<delimiter>Her stubborn lips remain in place!<delimiter>Onegin peers with searching gaze:<delimiter>Where, where’s the pity, perturbation?<delimiter>The tear stains, where? No trace, no trace,<delimiter>Anger alone has marked this face…
<h1>XXXIV</h1>
And, possibly the apprehension<delimiter>That monde or husband might suppose<delimiter>Some waywardness, some casual penchant…<delimiter>And everything Onegin knows…<delimiter>No hope! He drives from the reception,<delimiter>Cursing his crazy self-deception;<delimiter>Though part of it, he did not rue<delimiter>Bidding the monde again adieu;<delimiter>The silence of his study brought him<delimiter>Remembrance of another time,<delimiter>When in the loud monde’s pantomime,<delimiter>Khandra had cruelly chased and caught him,<delimiter>And seized him by the collar, then<delimiter>Enclosed him in his gloomy den.
<h1>XXXV</h1>
He read again, but all at random:<delimiter>Manzoni, Gibbon and Rousseau,<delimiter>Madame de Staël, Chamfort in tandem,<delimiter>Bichat and Herder and Tissot.<delimiter>He read the sceptic Bayle,who led him<delimiter>To Fontenelle, and when he’d read him,<delimiter>He tried some authors of our own<delimiter>Without rejecting anyone —<delimiter>The almanachs, reviews that ever<delimiter>Are drumming sermons into us,<delimiter>And treating me with animus,<delimiter>But where, time was, I might discover<delimiter>Such madrigals to me back then:<delimiter>E sempre bene, gentlemen!
<h1>XXXVI</h1>
But even while his eyes were reading,<delimiter>His thoughts were far away, as old<delimiter>Desires, dreams, sorrows kept invading<delimiter>And crowding deep inside his soul.<delimiter>Between the lines before him, printed,<delimiter>His inward eye saw others hinted.<delimiter>On these he concentrated most,<delimiter>In their decipherment engrossed.<delimiter>These were the secret legends, fictions<delimiter>The heart’s dark story had collected,<delimiter>The dreams with all else unconnected,<delimiter>The threats, the rumours, the predictions,<delimiter>Or else some lengthy, crazy tale<delimiter>Or letters from a fledgling give.
<h1>XXXVII</h1>
And by degrees his thought and feeling<delimiter>By lethargy are overcome,<delimiter>Meanwhile, imagination’s dealing<delimiter>Its motley faro cards to him.<delimiter>He sees on melted snow, recumbent,<delimiter>As if asleep at some encampment,<delimiter>A youth on his nocturnal bed<delimiter>And hears a voice: ‘Well then, he’s dead!’<delimiter>He sees past enemies forgotten,<delimiter>Base cowards and calumniators,<delimiter>A swarm of youthful, female traitors,<delimiter>A group of former friends turned rotten,<delimiter>And then a country house — where she<delimiter>Sits at the window… constantly.
<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
Such musings soon became a habit<delimiter>And nearly drove him off his head<delimiter>Or, failing this, made him a poet —<delimiter>That would have been a boon, indeed!<delimiter>Truly: by means of magnetism<delimiter>He almost grasped the mechanism<delimiter>Of Russian poetry of the time —<delimiter>This muddled neophyte of mine.<delimiter>He looked a poet to the letter:<delimiter>Ensconced before a blazing hearth,<delimiter>He sat alone as flames would dart,<delimiter>Hummed Idol Mio, Benedetta,<delimiter>And dropped into the fire, unseen,<delimiter>A slipper or a magazine.
<h1>XXXIX</h1>
Winter, as warming air blew through it,<delimiter>Was over now; the days rushed by;<delimiter>And he did not become a poet,<delimiter>Nor turn insane, nor did he die.<delimiter>Enlivened by the spring’s returning,<delimiter>He leaves upon one cloudless morning<delimiter>The shuttered rooms, where he had spent<delimiter>The winter like a marmot pent.<delimiter>From fireplace and the double windows,<delimiter>By sleigh, past the Neva he flies.<delimiter>Upon blue blocks of hewn-out ice<delimiter>The sun disports; in dirty cinders<delimiter>The furrowed snow melts on the street:<delimiter>Where, then, upon it with such speed
<h1>XL</h1>
Is he proceeding? Oh, already<delimiter>You’ve guessed, you’re right: my unreformed<delimiter>Eccentric’s rushing to his lady,<delimiter>To his Tatiana, unforewarned.<delimiter>He walks in like a corpse, nobody<delimiter>Is there to greet him in the lobby.<delimiter>In the reception room there’s not<delimiter>A soul. A door he opens… what<delimiter>What confronts him then, what makes him shudder?<delimiter>Before him the Princess alone<delimiter>Sits pale and unadorned, forlorn,<delimiter>Immersed in what looks like a letter,<delimiter>A flood of tears she softly sheds<delimiter>With cheek on hand… Ah, what regrets,
<h1>XLI</h1>
What silent sufferings were reflected<delimiter>In this quick moment of distress!<delimiter>Who is it could not have detected<delimiter>Poor Tanya in the new princess!<delimiter>Eugene, the moment that he saw her,<delimiter>Fell maddened with remorse before her.<delimiter>She gave a start, said not a word<delimiter>And looked at Eugene unperturbed<delimiter>Without surprise or wrath… His fading<delimiter>Appearance, his extinguished look,<delimiter>Imploring aspect, mute rebuke<delimiter>She takes in all. The simple maiden<delimiter>Returns again now, reappears<delimiter>With dreams and heart of former years.
<h1>XLII</h1>
She lets Onegin go on kneeling<delimiter>And, looking at him fixedly,<delimiter>Does not withdraw her hand unfeeling<delimiter>That he is kissing avidly…<delimiter>What is she dreaming of at present?<delimiter>A long time passes by, quiescent,<delimiter>At last she softly speaks again:<delimiter>‘Enough, get up. I must explain<delimiter>Myself to you. I wonder whether,<delimiter>Onegin, you recall, do you,<delimiter>The garden and the avenue,<delimiter>The hour when fate brought us together<delimiter>And how you lectured me, so meek.<delimiter>Today it is my turn to speak.
<h1>XLIII</h1>
‘I was much younger at that meeting<delimiter>And better looking, to my mind,<delimiter>I loved you then, was that upsetting?<delimiter>And in your heart, what did I find?<delimiter>What was your answer? Only sternness.<delimiter>You’d never, would you, take in earnest<delimiter>A little maiden’s modest love.<delimiter>My blood runs cold now — God above! —<delimiter>The very moment I remember<delimiter>Your chilling glance, that sermon… I’m<delimiter>Not blaming you: at that dark time<delimiter>You showed at least a noble temper<delimiter>And you were right regarding me,<delimiter>I thank you for your honesty…
<h1>XLIV</h1>
‘Admit that in our backwoods haven,<delimiter>From empty rumour far away,<delimiter>I was not to your liking… Say, then,<delimiter>Why you’re pursuing me today.<delimiter>Why have you marked me for attention?<delimiter>Might it not be because convention<delimiter>Includes me in the social round,<delimiter>Because I’m wealthy and renowned,<delimiter>Because my husband’s wounds in battle<delimiter>Have gained him royal favour, fame?<delimiter>Might it not be because my shame<delimiter>Would feed the flames of tittle-tattle<delimiter>And win you, in society,<delimiter>Seductive notoriety?
<h1>XLV</h1>
‘I weep… if you recall your Tanya,<delimiter>There’s one thing you should hear from me:<delimiter>Your sharp reproach, unfriendly manner,<delimiter>Your cold, unsparing homily,<delimiter>All this, with which you made me cower,<delimiter>I’d have preferred, had I the power,<delimiter>To this offensive passion, to<delimiter>The letters, tears I’ve had from you.<delimiter>You showed my childish dreams compassion,<delimiter>And you at least respected me<delimiter>And my young age. But now, I see<delimiter>You at my feet in coward fashion?<delimiter>How with the heart and mind you have<delimiter>Can you be paltry feeling’s slave?
<h1>XLVI</h1>
‘This pomp, Onegin, these excesses,<delimiter>The trumpery of hateful days,<delimiter>My high society successes,<delimiter>My fashionable house, soirées,<delimiter>What do they mean? Oh, I’d surrender<delimiter>At once this masquerade, this splendour,<delimiter>With all its glitter, noise and smoke<delimiter>For one wild garden and a book,<delimiter>For our poor home, to me the dearest,<delimiter>For all those places I recall,<delimiter>Where I beheld you first of all,<delimiter>And for the humble churchyard near us,<delimiter>Where now a cross and branches shade<delimiter>The grave where my poor nurse is laid…
<h1>XLVII</h1>
‘And yet that time was so auspicious<delimiter>And happiness so near… But no,<delimiter>My fate is settled. Injudicious<delimiter>I may have been, but it is so.<delimiter>With tears my mother begged, entreated<delimiter>And I, poor Tanya, listless, ceded,<delimiter>All lots were equal anyhow…<delimiter>I married. Pray you, leave me now.<delimiter>Your heart is honest and I prize it:<delimiter>And there resides in it true pride<delimiter>With candid honour, side by side.<delimiter>I love you (why should I disguise it?),<delimiter>But I am someone else’s wife,<delimiter>To him I shall be true for life.
<h1>XLVIII</h1>
She goes. He stands in desolation<delimiter>As if by thunder struck. In what<delimiter>A sudden tempest of sensation<delimiter>His heart’s ungovernably caught!<delimiter>But then a clink of spurs resounded,<delimiter>Tatiana’s husband he encountered.<delimiter>And, reader, now, in this mischance,<delimiter>In this unhappy circumstance,<delimiter>We’ll leave my hero to his meeting<delimiter>For long… for ever… in his track<delimiter>We’ve roamed around the world and back.<delimiter>On land again, let’s send our greeting<delimiter>To each and all. So, now, hurrah!<delimiter>It’s high time (you’ll agree), by far.
<h1>XLIX</h1>
Whatever, reader, your opinion,<delimiter>A friend or foe, I wish to part<delimiter>With you today like a companion.<delimiter>Farewell. Whatever you may chart<delimiter>Among these careless lines, reflections —<delimiter>Whether tumultuous recollections<delimiter>Or light relief from labour’s yoke,<delimiter>The lively image, witty joke<delimiter>Or the mistakes I’ve made in grammar —<delimiter>God grant you find here just a grain<delimiter>To warm the heart, to entertain,<delimiter>To feed a dream, and cause a clamour<delimiter>With journals and their clientele,<delimiter>Upon which, let us part, farewell!
<h1>L</h1>
Goodbye, strange comrade, now for ever,<delimiter>And you, my true ideal — now gone,<delimiter>Goodbye, my lively, long endeavour,<delimiter>Though slender work. With you I’ve known<delimiter>The things that every poet covets:<delimiter>Oblivion, when the tempest buffets,<delimiter>Sweet talk of friends. So many days<delimiter>Have passed since in a dreamy haze<delimiter>I first saw young Tatiana near me,<delimiter>With her, Onegin — and when I<delimiter>Looked through the magic crystal’s eye,<delimiter>I could not yet distinguish clearly<delimiter>The distant reach of the domain<delimiter>That my free novel would attain.
<h1>LI</h1>
But of those friends who, meeting, listened<delimiter>To those first strophes that I wrote…<delimiter>Some are no more now, some are distant,<delimiter>As Sadi once said in a note.<delimiter>They’ve missed the fully fledged Onegin,<delimiter>And she, from whom the model’s taken<delimiter>For dear Tatiana, she is gone…<delimiter>Oh, much by fate has been undone!<delimiter>Blest who betimes has left life’s revel,<delimiter>Whose wine-filled glass he has not drained,<delimiter>Who does not read right to the end<delimiter>Life’s still, as yet, unfinished novel,<delimiter>But lets it go, as I do my<delimiter>Onegin, and bid him goodbye.
<h1>Fragments of Onegin’s journey</h1>
Foreword<delimiter>The omitted stanzas gave rise to frequent reproofs and gibes (no doubt most just and witty). The author candidly confesses that he deleted from his novel an entire chapter describing Onegin’s journey through Russia. It was incumbent on him to indicate this omitted chapter by means of dots or a numeral; but in order to avoid confusion he decided it would be better to mark the last chapter as number eight instead of nine, and to sacrifice one of its closing stanzas:<delimiter>It’s time: for peace the pen is asking;<delimiter>Nine cantos done, and ninth the wave<delimiter>That lifts my boat and sets it basking<delimiter>Upon the joyous seashore, safe —<delimiter>Praise be to you, O nine Camenae, etc.<delimiter>P. A. Katenin (whom a fine poetic talent does not prevent from being also a subtle critic) remarked to us that this deletion, while perhaps advantageous for the reader, spoils the plan of the entire work, since, as a result, the transition from Tatiana the provincial miss to Tatiana the grande dame becomes too unexpected and unexplained — an observation revealing the experienced artist. The author himself felt the justice of this, but decided to leave out the chapter for reasons important to him and not to the public. Some fragments have been published; we give them here with several adjoining stanzas.<delimiter>E. Onegin leaves Moscow for Nizhny Novgorod:<delimiter>… In front of him,<delimiter>Makaryev, kicking up a shindy,<delimiter>Seethes with its rich emporium:<delimiter>Pearls imported by the Indian,<delimiter>Wines by the European watered,<delimiter>The breeder from the steppe-land speeds<delimiter>To sell his herd of cast-off steeds;<delimiter>The gamester wagers all his cash on<delimiter>His card decks and obliging dice,<delimiter>The squire brings daughters ripe in size,<delimiter>His daughters come with last year’s fashion,<delimiter>Each bustles, lies enough for two —<delimiter>A trading spirit rules right through.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Ennui!<delimiter>Onegin travels to Astrakhan, and thence to the Caucasus.<delimiter>He sees the wayward Terek, scoring<delimiter>Its banks in their abrupt descent,<delimiter>In front of him an eagle soaring,<delimiter>A standing deer with antlers bent;<delimiter>A camel lies in rocky shadows.<delimiter>And a Circassian’s steed through meadows<delimiter>Races; the sheep of Kalmuks graze<delimiter>Round nomad tents; Onegin’s gaze<delimiter>Takes in the far Caucasian masses.<delimiter>The way is opened: war defied<delimiter>The country’s natural divide,<delimiter>The perils of its mountain passes;<delimiter>Where the Kura, Aragva whirled,<delimiter>There were the Russian tents unfurled.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Now, watchman of the desolation,<delimiter>Beshtu, hemmed in by hills, is seen,<delimiter>Sharp-peaked, at its eternal station,<delimiter>And there Mashuk, now turning green,<delimiter>Pours healing streams from its recesses;<delimiter>Around its magic brooklets presses<delimiter>A pallid swarm of invalids,<delimiter>The victims, some of martial deeds,<delimiter>Others of piles or Aphrodite;<delimiter>These sufferers hope to reinforce<delimiter>Life’s thread at this prodigious source:<delimiter>Coquettes — to drown the notoriety<delimiter>Of wicked years, and ancient men —<delimiter>To bring back briefly youth again.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Immersed in bitter meditation,<delimiter>Amidst this melancholy crew,<delimiter>Onegin looks with lamentation<delimiter>Upon the waters’ steamy flow,<delimiter>And thinks, with sadness overclouded:<delimiter>Why has no bullet in me landed?<delimiter>Why is it I’m not old, infirm,<delimiter>Like him, poor taxman at his term?<delimiter>Why is it I’m not paralytic<delimiter>Like him, the clerk of Tula town?<delimiter>Why don’t I in my shoulder bone<delimiter>Feel just the slightest bit rheumatic?<delimiter>I’m young, o Lord, there’s life in me:<delimiter>What’s there to come? Ennui, ennui!<delimiter>Onegin then visits Tauris:<delimiter>You, land of the imagination:<delimiter>Saw Pylades, Orestes strive,<delimiter>And Mithridates take his life;<delimiter>There Mickiewicz sang his passion<delimiter>And midst the coastal cliffs afar<delimiter>Recalled his Lithuania.
<h1>* * *</h1>
How beautiful, when day is dawning,<delimiter>To see you, shores of Tauris, when<delimiter>My ship reflects the star of morning —<delimiter>Thus first you came into my ken;<delimiter>In bridal brilliance apparent,<delimiter>The sky behind you, blue, transparent,<delimiter>The masses of your mountains shone,<delimiter>Villages, trees and valleys spun<delimiter>A pattern spreading out before me.<delimiter>And there, among the Tatar dens…<delimiter>What ardour roused my sleeping sense!<delimiter>What magic longing caught me, bore me<delimiter>What yearning pressed my flaming heart!<delimiter>But with the past, Muse, let me part.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Whatever feelings then lay hidden<delimiter>Within me — now they are no more:<delimiter>They went or changed, no longer bidden…<delimiter>Peace unto you, alarms of yore!<delimiter>It seemed it was the wild I needed,<delimiter>The pearl-edged waves that flowed, receded,<delimiter>The noise of sea, the rocks’ cascade,<delimiter>And my ideal of proud, young maid,<delimiter>And nameless torment, tribulation…<delimiter>Now other days, now other dreams,<delimiter>My springtime’s fancies, high-flown themes<delimiter>You’ve quietened down, with resignation,<delimiter>And into my poetic glass<delimiter>Much water have I mixed, alas.
<h1>* * *</h1>
I need another kind of image:<delimiter>A sandy, sloping eminence,<delimiter>Two rowans and a little cottage,<delimiter>A wicket gate, a broken fence,<delimiter>The sky when greyish clouds are passing,<delimiter>The straw before the thresh-barn massing,<delimiter>A pond beneath dense willow trees<delimiter>And ducklings doing as they please;<delimiter>I’ m fond now of the balalaika<delimiter>And, at the tavern’s door, the pack<delimiter>Of drunkards stamping the trepak.<delimiter>Now my ideal’s a housewife — like her,<delimiter>It’s peace alone that I desire,<delimiter>‘And cabbage soup, while I’m the squire.’
<h1>* * *</h1>
When recently in rainy weather<delimiter>I dropped into the cattle yard…<delimiter>But fie on such prosaic blather,<delimiter>The motley dross of Flemish art!<delimiter>Was such my habit in my heyday?<delimiter>O fountain of Bakhchisaray, say!<delimiter>Were such the thoughts your endless sound<delimiter>Communicated to my mind,<delimiter>When, watching you in silent wonder,<delimiter>Zarema first appeared to me<delimiter>Midst empty halls of luxury?…<delimiter>Three years since then, and who should wander<delimiter>Along my tracks, if not Eugene,<delimiter>Recalling me, though long unseen.
<h1>* * *</h1>
I lived in dust-submerged Odessa…<delimiter>There for a long time skies are clear,<delimiter>Abundant trade that knows no leisure<delimiter>Readies its sails for every sphere;<delimiter>By Europe all things are invaded,<delimiter>The South shines out in variegated<delimiter>And lively multiformity.<delimiter>The tongue of golden Italy<delimiter>Resounds along the merry pavement,<delimiter>Where our imperious Slav walks cheek-<delimiter>By-jowl with Frenchman, Spaniard, Greek,<delimiter>Armenian, ponderous Moldavian<delimiter>And son of Egypt, Morali,<delimiter>Corsair, retired now from the sea.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Our friend Tumansky has depicted<delimiter>Odessa in resounding rhyme,<delimiter>But partiality restricted<delimiter>His observations at the time.<delimiter>Arriving in the town, our poet,<delimiter>Armed with lorgnette, set off to know it,<delimiter>Alone, above the sea — and then,<delimiter>Employing an enchanting pen,<delimiter>Extolled the gardens of Odessa.<delimiter>All that is well and good, except<delimiter>That round about is naked steppe;<delimiter>In some few spots a recent measure<delimiter>Has forced young boughs on sultry days<delimiter>To mitigate the solar rays.
<h1>* * *</h1>
But where now is my rambling story?<delimiter>Inside Odessa’s dust bowl, I<delimiter>Might well have said its ‘dirty quarry’,<delimiter>And that would not have been a lie.<delimiter>For five, six weeks a year Odessa,<delimiter>At Zeus’s tempest-bringing pleasure,<delimiter>Is flooded, blocked, its conduits burst,<delimiter>Into the thickest mud immersed,<delimiter>With houses sinking two feet under;<delimiter>Only pedestrians on stilts<delimiter>Dare breach the cumulative silts;<delimiter>The coaches and the people flounder,<delimiter>And oxen, horns inclined, replace<delimiter>The horses with their feeble pace.
<h1>* * *</h1>
But hammers are already cracking<delimiter>The stones, and soon the sunken town<delimiter>Will have acquired a novel backing<delimiter>As if with armour plated down.<delimiter>However, in this moist Odessa<delimiter>There’s something missing to refresh her;<delimiter>Why, water! What would you have thought?<delimiter>Some reconstruction must be wrought…<delimiter>But really, this is no great sorrow,<delimiter>Particularly, you’ll agree,<delimiter>When wine’s imported duty-free.<delimiter>There’s Southern sun and sea tomorrow…<delimiter>Where better, friends, to spend your time<delimiter>Or find a more propitious clime?
<h1>* * *</h1>
Time was, no sooner had day risen,<delimiter>Marked by the naval cannonry,<delimiter>Than, running down with expedition,<delimiter>I’d leave the steep shore for the sea.<delimiter>Then, by the briny breakers freshened,<delimiter>Smoking a pipe near incandescent,<delimiter>Like Muslims in their paradise,<delimiter>Coffee with Eastern grounds I’d prize,<delimiter>And leave then for a stroll. Already,<delimiter>The generous casino hums;<delimiter>Cups clash; the sleepy marker comes<delimiter>On to the balcony, unsteady,<delimiter>With broom in hand, while at the hall<delimiter>Two merchants, meeting, make their call.
<h1>* * *</h1>
Look now — the square has put on motley.<delimiter>All is alive: the people there,<delimiter>On business or without, run hotly,<delimiter>But most of them with some affair.<delimiter>The merchant, child of cautious daring,<delimiter>Tells from the ensigns how he’s faring,<delimiter>Whether he’s favoured by the skies<delimiter>With sails that he can recognize.<delimiter>What novel wares from sundry nations<delimiter>Have entered into quarantine?<delimiter>Where are the promised casks of wine?<delimiter>What news of plague and conflagrations?<delimiter>Of famine or another war,<delimiter>Or something new, but similar?
<h1>* * *</h1>
But we, young fellows, blithely standing<delimiter>Alongside anxious merchants, had<delimiter>Eyes only for the vessel landing,<delimiter>That brought us oysters from Tsargrad.<delimiter>Has it arrived? What joy, what pleasure!<delimiter>Youth, avaricious beyond measure,<delimiter>Flies off to swallow from the shell<delimiter>The cloistered molluscs, live and well,<delimiter>Besprinkling them with lemon lightly.<delimiter>Noise, arguments — light wine is brought<delimiter>Straight from the cellars to our board,<delimiter>Where good Oton serves us politely.<delimiter>The hours fly by, while the account<delimiter>Reaches unseen a grim amount.
<h1>* * *</h1>
But evening’s blue already thickens,<delimiter>The opera now calls to us,<delimiter>Rossini, Europe’s darling, beckons —<delimiter>Th’ intoxicating Orpheus.<delimiter>To criticism inattentive,<delimiter>Selfsame as ever, new, inventive,<delimiter>He pours out tunes that effervesce,<delimiter>Cascade and flow and incandesce,<delimiter>They burn like youthful lovers’ kisses<delimiter>In flames of love, in luxury,<delimiter>Or like the spurt and golden spray<delimiter>Of an Aí when out it fizzes…<delimiter>But, gentlemen, who can define<delimiter>Do-re-mi-sol in terms of wine?
<h1>* * *</h1>
But are these all its delectations?<delimiter>What of the quizzical lorgnette?<delimiter>What of the backstage assignations?<delimiter>The prima donna, the ballet?<delimiter>The box where, in her beauty shining,<delimiter>A trader’s youthful wife, reclining,<delimiter>Disdainful and in languid pose,<delimiter>Whom pressing throngs of slaves enclose?<delimiter>She hears, hears not the cavatina,<delimiter>Nor the entreaties or the jests,<delimiter>Halfway with flattery expressed…<delimiter>While just behind her in a corner<delimiter>Her husband dozes, shouts ‘encore’,<delimiter>Yawns — and begins again to snore.
<h1>* * *</h1>
At last there thunders the finale;<delimiter>The noisy audience greets the night;<delimiter>The square to which the people rally<delimiter>Is lit by stars and lantern light.<delimiter>Ausonia’s sons are gently singing<delimiter>A playful tune that goes on ringing<delimiter>Inside their heads and will not leave,<delimiter>While we roar out the recitative.<delimiter>But it is late. Odessa’s sleeping;<delimiter>The night is warm and mute and still.<delimiter>The moon has risen, and a veil,<delimiter>Diaphanously light, is draping<delimiter>The sky. All’s silent; save the roar<delimiter>Of Black Sea waves upon the shore…
<h1>* * *</h1>
And so I lived then in Odessa…

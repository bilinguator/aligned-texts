<h1>Shuraleh</h1><delimiter>Translated by Lalja Gilmanova
<h1>I</h1>
In vicinity of Kazan there’s a village named Kyrlai,<delimiter>Their chorus is the mightiest when its cocks in loud cry.<delimiter>Not that born was I in Kyrlai, but I stayed there for a while,<delimiter>Hard at work with harrowing, sowing, harvesting — all in due time.
I remember thick black forest, by the village like a wall,<delimiter>I remember field and lawn, soft as velvet in the dawn.<delimiter>Would you think that village’s big? — No, my dear, not at all.<delimiter>Here is fresh water taken from the cheerful spring hole.
Air isn’t cold or hot — it’s all comfortable there.<delimiter>When the raspberry — strawberry paint red the nearest lawn,<delimiter>In a blink of eye your pail will be filled with their lot!
Fascinating land! Pines, fir-trees like the guardians stay alert,<delimiter>Often used to rest beneath them, turning powerful twice more.<delimiter>Here or there seeing mushrooms, sorrel, buds or flowers’ blossom<delimiter>Under birch or aspen-tree — having been obsessed too close to them
Such a balmy air’s here from those blooming fragrancies,<delimiter>Colored blue and colored yellow, variegated red, white, lilac!<delimiter>And so motley butterflies are, making rivalry to bloom,<delimiter>Flying, taking off and coming, — fed with nectar are they all!
And you feel sometimes as if birds of Paradise are singing,<delimiter>Making heart stop sweetly still, and your soul wings do quiver.<delimiter>All in one place, here they are! — theater, orchestra and ballet,<delimiter>Concert, circus, boulevard — all that makes you ever jolly!
Huge as Khan Chingiz’s troops, like the giant with thousands heads<delimiter>Endless forest starting there, as deep ocean rise in waves.<delimiter>I see through the ancient time, our forefathers lived in,<delimiter>Their glory, their names, lovely stories, lovely views<delimiter>Of their honorable state.<delimiter>As if curtains on the stage open are again<delimiter>And at last you see them all, wondering what we are now —<delimiter>Still, we are the sons of Lord blessed!

I described the summer beauties, — autumn, winter are ahead.<delimiter>Maids innocent and black eyes will be featured a bit later.<delimiter>Sabantui celebrations, horse race, holidays on site<delimiter>If I each of them remember, I’ll be too far from my path.
Well, you see, that I’m diverted, thinking of the village fun,<delimiter>Would you tell me what’s the title? — «Shuraleh» is signed above.<delimiter>Wait a minute, please, my dear, friend of mine, you see my puzzle<delimiter>In the moment when the village views again come into my mind.

And of course, that dense thick forest as we see it nearby<delimiter>Is a home to wolves and foxes — every beast of pray alive.<delimiter>Here a bear is sure to meet you, if you hunt him in a brake,<delimiter>These are common things to hunter — seeing hare, facing elk.
But they say, black forest’s homeland for the evil spirit crew:<delimiter>Devils, werewolves and goblins, shuralehs are frequent, too.<delimiter>Why not? Endless forest shows miracles, as do the skies —<delimiter>Many miracles in heaven, never seen and never tried!
<h1>IV</h1>
That’s a nice start to my story — small narration that I tell:<delimiter>It was summer full-moon evening, when Dzhigit left home, he dwelt,<delimiter>Making horse-way to the forest — needs some firewood to get.
Stars were twinkling in the sky, horse was mettlesome, indeed —<delimiter>In a blink the dense drew nearer, and Dzhigit was inside it.<delimiter>Fascinating silence seized him, when he looked around, amazed.<delimiter>Dzhigit took to work at once, cutting firewood with ax.
Oh, indeed, Dzhigit was master of his job, and quick at work,<delimiter>Night was flying by, invisible, as his ax was cutting log.<delimiter>Taken breath was light and free, and cool air braced Dzhigit,<delimiter>Ax in hand, — and there was nothing to retard him in his deed.<delimiter>Suddenly, the tranquil air has been broken by a cry,<delimiter>And the woodcutter has shuddered, as if bitten by a fly.
Then he stood alert, all ear, to see Something on the path —<delimiter>Was it spirit or a human, or a werewolf’s black mouth?
Who was that disgusting monster, smiling such an awful smile?<delimiter>Ugly nose of the being touched his chin, as long as knife.<delimiter>Long thin hair of a beard, knotty all from top to toe,<delimiter>Deep black eyes without eyelids were sparkling as a coal.
He was somewhat like a human, thin and lean, — if not a horn,<delimiter>Black horn, finger-size was leaning, middle forehead sticking on.<delimiter>Neither daylight, nor in night-time could you stand his look — God save!<delimiter>Though his crooked arms had the fingers, straight and long as are the nails.

So they stared at each other for a long time, and Dzhigit<delimiter>Bravely asked the ugly being: «Who are you and what’s your wish?»<delimiter>«Don’t be scared, you, the human, I am not an outlaw.<delimiter>Nor as innocent as baby, I am used to cheat you all.
When I see the lone person in the forest — tickle guy,<delimiter>Now I see that you are single, and I dance for joy and cry!
Show me your fingers quickly, let me closer to see,<delimiter>You’ll play titi-titi-titi — titillating game with me!»<delimiter>«Well, I’m not against at all, no objections but at first<delimiter>Meet my will, it’s not as big…» — «Tell me everything you want.
I’m at your disposal, only hurry up, I’ll keep my word».<delimiter>«Well, I see that you agree with my offer, — learn it now:<delimiter>See that heavy fir-tree beam? If I help you, on your turn
Will you take it to my truck?<delimiter>Beam is chopped on your side — easy carry, easy go!<delimiter>Take the log by split and thus let us draw it on the slow.<delimiter>Have you caught idea? — then hurry up, you, timber-cow!»
Shuraleh has followed strictly orders told him by Dzhigit,<delimiter>Quickly fixed his fingers in long and deep split of the beam.<delimiter>Now I think, you are aware, what woodcutter plotted on:
There was a wooden wedge in open mouth of the log.<delimiter>Sly Dzhigit was very tricky, slightly hammering his ax.<delimiter>Shuraleh was quite submissive, sure that he winner was.
Wooden wedge was loosened free by the knocks of ax at last,<delimiter>Shuraleh’s ten fingers were clutched by the beam — so fast!<delimiter>That was moment, Shuraleh cried of pain and saw the trick,<delimiter>Pleading with his forest brothers to release him in a blink.
Shuraleh was begging Dzhigit, praying him as saint:<delimiter>«Oh Batyr, release, forgive me, save me for God’s sake!<delimiter>Swear you, oh mighty human, forward since today<delimiter><delimiter>I shall serve your will and never dare to attack!<delimiter>And your progeny and offspring never be unsafe,
And my brothers in the forest will take care of them.<delimiter>Strolling in the forest never will be blame.<delimiter>Let’s make peace, you see, enough I am chastised, bless you God!<delimiter>Do you like my troubles and pains?» — suffered poor creature, crawled.
Silently Dzhigit was leaving for his home without a word,<delimiter>Seeing no other reason in the monster’s screams and oath.<delimiter>Holding horse by bridle gently, stepped he forward, free to act…<delimiter>Seeing that he wouldn’t follow him, Shuraleh said in despair:<delimiter>«Pitiless you are and hostile to the peaceful Shuraleh,<delimiter>Only thing before you leave — tell me name of yours, Dzhigit!
Hope, that hearing my voice, brothers rescue me tomorrow —<delimiter>If me only to survive — then they ask the name of wrongdoer».<delimiter>«Well, calm down and be quiet, — said the daredevil boldly, —<delimiter>«Past» my name is, understood? I should be your elder brother.<delimiter>Now I’m leaving, say good-bye, and don’t worry, cheer up!»
Shuraleh still screaming, weeping asked for pity more and more,<delimiter>Pleading, threatening, entreating, loosing head of grief and sorrow:<delimiter>«Help! Release me from the split! Crime against me is sure —<delimiter>Past has squeezed my fingers, cheat! Devil, gangster, killed me, poor!»
In the dawn the shuralehs came to see him on the place:<delimiter>«Crazy, silly, senseless creature, long and loud is your cry,<delimiter>Shut your mouth and be silent, for your screams too stupid are,<delimiter>Squeezed your fingers in the past, then why are crying you at moment?!»

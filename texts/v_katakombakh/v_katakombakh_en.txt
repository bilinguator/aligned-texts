<h1>In the Catacombs</h1><delimiter>Translated from Ukrainian by David Turow
Dedicated to my respected blood brother A. Crumsky
Catacombs near Rome. A small community of Christians is assembled in a crypt, poorly lighted with oil lamps and thin wax candles. The Bishop is ending his sermon, while his audience is standing by reverently, silently, and obediently.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Lord Jesus let us praise, my bothers,<delimiter>who made a place right by his throne<delimiter>for our martyred brother Harikeus.
<b>The Choir</b><delimiter>In heavens glory to Lord Jesus Christ,<delimiter>who liberates from worldly handcuffs,<delimiter>who leads us out of the jail of sin<delimiter>into the kingdom of eternal light.
<b>The Deacon</b><delimiter>Amen.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Our brother was on earth a mere slave,<delimiter>and now Jesus is his one and only master.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>He’ll have a master even after death?<delimiter>You said, there’s neither slave nor master<delimiter>in Paradise!
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>And that’s the gospel truth:<delimiter>before God all are equal.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Even slaves?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>God’s slaves, remember, dear brother.<delimiter>Sweet is my yoke,—Jesus said,—<delimiter>light is my burden. Do you see?
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(having thought hard)<delimiter>I don’t!<delimiter>I can’t. I cannot understand this word.
<b>A Female Christian Slave</b><delimiter>(suddenly prophesies)<delimiter>An axe is lying by the tree already!<delimiter>“I’ll cut it down and will make it burn,”—<delimiter>the Lord said!… Come, o come, please come,<delimiter>Lord Jesus, Son of God! Kneeling down,<delimiter>your wheat is waiting, ready for the sickle…<delimiter>When will you come, my lord? Look: Rachel’s weeping,<delimiter>Her kids are gone…
(Nonsensical speech changes to impassioned lament, other women also begin to cry, some of men can bear it no longer either.)
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter> (in a commanding, strong voice)<delimiter>Away, Satan, begone!<delimiter>You have no power here!<delimiter>(Approaches the prophetess, who is convulsing, and places his hand on her head.)<delimiter>Sister,<delimiter>may you receive salvation through your faith<delimiter>from the delusions of the evil spirit.
The woman gradually quiets down under his steady gaze and helplessly drops into the supporting hands of her girlfriends.
<b>A Christian Woman</b><delimiter>(one of those who are supporting the prophetess. Speaks with a timid voice.)<delimiter>Father,<delimiter>her master sold the other day her child<delimiter>to some Corinthian Greek…
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Be quiet!<delimiter>Our great apostle once commanded,<delimiter>“A woman should be quiet at a meeting”.
In the meantime, the prophetess is lead out. Silence.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(approaches The Bishop. With a desperately polite, trembling from bewilderment voice)<delimiter>I’m sorry, but I still don’t understand<delimiter>how any yoke may be sweet or pleasant,<delimiter>how heavy can be light.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>My brother,<delimiter>if of your own will you lower your neck<delimiter>into Christ’s yoke, then your soul will feel<delimiter>its sweetness; will a cross feel heavy<delimiter>to you if willingly you take it up—<delimiter>no matter how heavy?
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>But what for<delimiter>should willingly we harness ourselves<delimiter>and move around crosses of our own free will,<delimiter>when we have suffered so much as slaves?<delimiter>Our necks, our souls are rubbed sore<delimiter>from those yokes and from those crosses!<delimiter>I did not come to you to join the church<delimiter>in search of yokes or in search of crosses.<delimiter>Oh no, liberty is what I’m looking for,<delimiter>for it is said, “no lords and no slaves”.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>And you’ll enjoy this liberty, my brother,<delimiter>as soon as you accept the yoke of Christ.<delimiter>Among themselves, the Lord’s slaves are all equal.<delimiter>Your burden you will carry through this world,<delimiter>and will arrive in the realm of our Lord,<delimiter>that kingdom where God’s the only ruler,<delimiter>and he is our father. If you didn’t<delimiter>accept the rule of our God the Father<delimiter>over yourself, your pride would be, my son,<delimiter>like Lucifer’s conceit.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>O father!<delimiter>What arrogance, what pride do slaves possess!<delimiter>All right, all right, let God, our holy father,<delimiter>rule over us, but when will that reign come?<delimiter>When will it come, where can we find God’s Kingdom?<delimiter>One brother said, it’s somewhere in the heavens,<delimiter>Another said, it’s here.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>They are both right.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>But where on Earth is it located?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Here.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>In Rome?!
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>In this church.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Right in the catacombs?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Don’t say, “it’s here” or “it’s over there.”<delimiter>It is wherever God’s in people’s souls.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>When will he penetrate all people’s souls?
The Bishop<delimiter>When Jesus, our savior, returns<delimiter>To earth from Heaven.
The Neophyte Slave<delimiter>(moodily)<delimiter>Someone told me once<delimiter>that it will take at least a thousand years<delimiter>until the second coming since the first…
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>That’s heresy, my brother: no one knows<delimiter>the day, nor hour…
The Neophyte Slave<delimiter>(continuing with joyous hope)<delimiter>This means that Jesus<delimiter>can come at any time to rule the world?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Undoubtedly so.
The Neophyte Slave ponders something and becomes sad again.
You seem troubled, brother.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>I thought you said that here is the Kingdom<delimiter>of God, among us… But then how come<delimiter>we’ve got Patricians here, and Plebeians,<delimiter>and also—slaves?
A Christian Patrician<delimiter>(steps slightly forward)<delimiter>You, brother, are perplexed,<delimiter>for now reason. I am a Patrician,<delimiter>he is my slave.<delimiter>(points at an elderly man)<delimiter>That’s our public image,—<delimiter>before God we are brothers, he and I.
The Neophyte Slave<delimiter>(to the old slave)<delimiter>Your being a slave is just an outward show?
<b>The Old Slave</b><delimiter>O no, I’m my master’s loyal servant,<delimiter>And I obey him with heart’s sincerity<delimiter>and reverence for God.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>If you are equal,<delimiter>then how come you have to serve your master?
<b>The Old Slave</b><delimiter>It was God’s will that he was born a lord,<delimiter>and I—a slave.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>So in God’s Kingdom, after all,<delimiter>There’s slaves and masters?
The Old Slave is silent.
<b>The Patrician</b><delimiter>Here we partake<delimiter>together holy blood and holy body,<delimiter>so here he is not my slave—I am willing<delimiter>to wash his feet, in fact.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>At home, too<delimiter>you eat with him at the same table?
<b>The Old Slave</b><delimiter>No, brother, that would have been wrong.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>But why?
<b>The Old Slave</b><delimiter>It isn’t right… not proper…
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(to The Neophyte Slave)<delimiter>Don’t tempt him. He is meek of spirit,<delimiter>and so close to God’s Holy Kingdom.<delimiter>For he is happy who is uncomplaining,<delimiter>he doesn’t care whether in this world<delimiter>he is a master or a slave.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>No, father,<delimiter>it’s not the same…<delimiter>(with emotional uplift)<delimiter>If you had only seen<delimiter>how yesterday my poor child was crying,—<delimiter>a patient, undemanding little baby,—<delimiter>because she couldn’t get her milk until the evening:<delimiter>my wife was helping out at an orgy<delimiter>and had no time to stop by our house<delimiter>to feed our baby. So now<delimiter>my child is sick, and even so my wife<delimiter>can shed no tears, since our master<delimiter>hates it when pretty slave girls are red-eyed.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>There is no need for tears. Even if<delimiter>your child does die,—she should expect<delimiter>great happiness in heaven.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Same amount<delimiter>of happiness a master’s child will get<delimiter>in heaven if he dies while still a baby?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(a bit troubled)<delimiter>Before God, every innocent’s the same.
The Neophyte Slave<delimiter>(with sadness)<delimiter>So a master’s baby will be doubly happy:<delimiter>first here on Earth, and after that—in heaven…
<b>The Old Slave</b><delimiter>Do not allow envy to destroy you,<delimiter>to soil your soul’s purity, my brother.<delimiter>Although you’re harassed by your pagan master<delimiter>(a Christian never would’ve tormented you so)—<delimiter>your wholesomeness he cannot destroy<delimiter>as long as your and your wife souls are pure.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>O, don’t burn me with your words, old man!<delimiter>Forgive me, you don’t know… I’m ashamed…<delimiter>Eh, slaves cannot feel shame! I’ll tell you!<delimiter>What “wholesomeness”, “purity of soul”?<delimiter>My soul is rotting every time I see<delimiter>my wife come home sometimes from an orgy,<delimiter>all flushed with fine, with fire in her eyes<delimiter>from shameful songs. The flowers in her hair,<delimiter>still fresh and fragrant, create such a contrast<delimiter>against the dirt and destitution of our home…<delimiter>My wife in haste removes her party garments<delimiter>and puts back on her old slave’s attire<delimiter>to keep it clean until the next time it is needed,<delimiter>and oftentimes I saw my wife in tears<delimiter>as she was changing… Gramps, I simply couldn’t,<delimiter>I couldn’t help but hit her for these tears,<delimiter>though I knew that this way our house<delimiter>would just become to her more hateful…
<b>The Patrician</b><delimiter>Brother,<delimiter>show your wife the way to our faith,<delimiter>then she will no longer cry<delimiter>over the vain world’s luxuries.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>My lord!—<delimiter>or should I call you “brother” here?,—you know,<delimiter>I dare not try teaching to my wife<delimiter>this new faith’ tenets. Let her keep on crying<delimiter>over clean garments and our lord’s mansion,<delimiter>than have to cry over the purity<delimiter>of soul and of body. Anyways,<delimiter>she cannot save herself no matter what,<delimiter>so then what good would be for her to know<delimiter>of sin and holiness? It’s better if she doesn’t.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>He who has sinned unwillingly is clean.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>We on occasion ourselves don’t know<delimiter>what willingly and what unwillingly we do…<delimiter>Sin or no sin, the heartache still persists…<delimiter>It’s hard for me to say this… I’m not sure:<delimiter>am I the baby’s father? or my lord?<delimiter>I love the child, yet sometimes I feel hate…
<b>An Old Woman</b><delimiter>It is a sin to hate: it’s not the baby’s fault.<delimiter>(Looks at The Bishop and falls silent.)
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Occasionally women, too, make sense.
A young but tired-looking, poorly dressed woman whispers something into the ear of a respectable old widow-deaconess.
<b>The Diaconess</b><delimiter>(to The Bishop)<delimiter>May I say something, most reverend father?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Speak, but be brief.
<b>The Diaconess</b><delimiter>(pointing at the young woman)<delimiter>This sister here wants<delimiter>to be of service to her poor brother.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>In what respect?
<b>The Diaconess</b><delimiter>She’s asking that his wife<delimiter>drop off the baby on her way for babysitting,<delimiter>as she is going to serve at your lord’s orgy,—<delimiter>the sister has a baby of her own,<delimiter>and can breastfeed them both, no problem,<delimiter>and take good care of the baby till the evening.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>[Bilinguator: Good deed, my daughter, before God.]
The young woman bows humbly.
<b>The Diaconess</b><delimiter>(to The Neophyte Slave)<delimiter>Please tell your wife to bring the baby<delimiter>to Deodatus–he’s a carpenter–whose house<delimiter>is two blocks on the right from the Small Forum,<delimiter>and leave it with his wife Ancillodeia:<delimiter>she guarantees the baby will be fine.
<b>Ancillodeia</b><delimiter>(the young woman. In a quiet voice to The Neophyte Slave)<delimiter>Refuse me not this favor, dear brother!
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(defeated)<delimiter>My deepest thanks!
<b>The Patrician</b><delimiter>And also visit me,<delimiter>I’ll give you clothes, although not new,<delimiter>but good enough, from my slave women,<delimiter>my wife and I have been too generous with them,<delimiter>so they can share with your wife for sure,<delimiter>if your lord doesn’t give enough to her.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(with restraint)<delimiter>Thank you, my lord.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(correcting him)<delimiter>My brother.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(indifferently)<delimiter>Well, whatever.
<b>A Christian Merchant</b><delimiter>I think you mentioned that your wife hates dirt,<delimiter>and that there’s filth inside your home. I will give<delimiter>you some free soap, just stop by: I guess your lord<delimiter>does not provide you with it.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(with a barely disguised irony)<delimiter>Right, you bet!
<b>The Deacon</b><delimiter>Perhaps you sometimes go hungry, brother,—<delimiter>most pagans don’t give enough to eat<delimiter>to their slaves,—so why don’t you visit us<delimiter>on Sundays, when we have a weekly feast<delimiter>(“Agape feast”—a dinner for the poor);<delimiter>you’ll have a decent and nutritious meal<delimiter>for body and for spirit also: sometimes,<delimiter>when dinner’s almost over, The Bishop,<delimiter>accompanied by elders of the church,<delimiter>drop in to teach us tenets of the faith,<delimiter>to let us taste Christ’s body and Christ’s blood,<delimiter>to wash the feet of their brothers. Come<delimiter>through the back entrance to my house. I’m an oiler,<delimiter>name’s Agathophiles, near the Thermi<delimiter>is where I live. And any of my neighbors<delimiter>will point you to the dwelling of the “weird<delimiter>eccentric man who likes to feed the rabble”.<delimiter>That’s what the pagans say about me.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(does not respond to the Deacon and stands for a while silently, holding his head in his hands)<delimiter>What have I come to! Woe is me, indeed!<delimiter>Though still young, I am like an old beggar!..<delimiter>Whom can I blame? Should I blame my father,<delimiter>who sold me into slavery for debts?<delimiter>Or those debts? Or maybe that rich man,<delimiter>the merchant of men’s souls? Or the day,<delimiter>the hour, the minute I was born?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Come down, poor wretch! What are you saying?<delimiter>Chase, chase away the evil spirit<delimiter>of pride and bitterness! It is a deadly sin<delimiter>to curse like that, especially right now,<delimiter>when brothers offer brotherly assistance<delimiter>to you so graciously.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>That brotherly assistance!<delimiter>It cut me to the quick, right in the heart!<delimiter>Look at this woman, she is so fatigued (points at Ancillodeia),<delimiter>she’s like a shadow from Hades, while my wife<delimiter>is young and healthy, but my poor son<delimiter>still goes hungry, though not an orphan,—<delimiter>his choice is to take food out of another’s mouth<delimiter>or starve to death while waiting for his mother<delimiter>to be done serving wine and pleasure to the lords.<delimiter>But that’s not all: I have to beg for clothes<delimiter>for my poor wife, who’s forced to whore herself,—<delimiter>I take from slaves old dresses for a slave,<delimiter>For there is no time for healthy hands to spin,<delimiter>there’s no time, for every day is holy.<delimiter>You say it is a sin to curse and to despair,<delimiter>but is it not a sin to take food from the hungry<delimiter>and clothes from the naked? And from whom?<delimiter>My own brothers, laborers and slaves…
<b>The Deacon</b><delimiter>The rich, the poor—here all donate.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>O yes, the soap, sorry, I forgot.<delimiter>I can get soap free from Brother Merchant<delimiter>to somehow assuage my slavish troubles,<delimiter>so that they don’t bother so much<delimiter>my wealthy brethren when we are in Paradise,<delimiter>or, god forbid, their poor brother will<delimiter>come once a week to the agape feast<delimiter>and spread his dirty, smelly clothes<delimiter>on that same bench where those in white tunics<delimiter>and in embroidered togas sit.
(to the Patrician)<delimiter>You better thank<delimiter>your comrade for that soap. After all,<delimiter>one day you may need to wash my feet<delimiter>as part of our Christian fraternizing,<delimiter>and they will be much cleaner and smell better,<delimiter>if I first wash at home them with soap,<delimiter>for I feel sorry for patrician hands.
The Patrician gets red in the face, but gets hold of himself and only looks at The Bishop.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(still in a soft, conrolled voice, but with a more severe tone)<delimiter>What evil spirit has possessed your heart?<delimiter>What are you punishing your brothers for<delimiter>with biting, hurtful, and heart-wounding words?<delimiter>What have we done to you to cause you to direct<delimiter>at us such anger?
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Sorrow, not anger,<delimiter>Great sorrow’s what I feel. I used to be a slave,<delimiter>a bondman who was sold, his freedom taken,<delimiter>removed by force,—and now you decided<delimiter>to also make me, in addition, a panhandler,<delimiter>to make me willingly extend my hand<delimiter>and beg for bread. You wanted me to wear,<delimiter>besides the yoke of slavery, another,<delimiter>a light, sweet yoke, that somehow,—<delimiter>You want me to believe, —will make the old one lighter.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>We were sincere when we told you this,<delimiter>and following the word of God.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>I don’t trust<delimiter>your honesty, nor do I trust your words.<delimiter>Had your desire to help others been sincere,—<delimiter>you see that gold and silver on your altar?—<delimiter>you would’ve spent not on communal feasts,<delimiter>you would’ve purchased slaves and give them freedom.
(to the Patrician)<delimiter>You sire, could have set us free with nothing,<delimiter>and we somehow would’ve gotten by ourselves<delimiter>both bread and cloths.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Who do we think we are<delimiter>to dare challenge will of the Almighty<delimiter>who is to be a slave, and who is to be free?<delimiter>What’s your concern? “Man shall not live by bread<delimiter>alone, but by every word.”—says Jesus,—<delimiter>“that comes from God”.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>It’s not enough for man<delimiter>to have just bread and words. A man needs freedom,<delimiter>or he’ll stagnate and suffer, and not live.<delimiter>That’s my concern, that’s my heartbreaking anguish:<delimiter>that you, instead of promised blessed life<delimiter>in God’s eternal, happy kingdom,<delimiter>give me just food, just clothes, and just words.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Not all words are the same or as important, brother:<delimiter>the words of God save souls so much better<delimiter>than any human deeds.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>What are those words?<delimiter>“Obedience and patience”—this is all<delimiter>I heard from you today. So do they really<delimiter>save human souls? Is it really true<delimiter>that Christians go for these two words to death<delimiter>upon the cross, to martyrdom, to torture,<delimiter>to serve as meals to beasts in the arena?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>They go willingly to die for that great Word,<delimiter>whose powerful meaning cannot be conveyed<delimiter>by human words.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>What kind of word is that?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>That word is—God. He is alpha and omega,<delimiter>the end and the beginning. He created<delimiter>all, and all lives by Him, and there are no other<delimiter>gods in the world beside this mighty God;<delimiter>He is the word, he’s power, he’s life.<delimiter>And all those whom the ignorant called gods,<delimiter>to whom they sacrificed—are just dumb idols,<delimiter>or evil spirits, servants of the Prince of Darkness.<delimiter>So this is why they torture, crucify us:<delimiter>because we don’t want to serve these idols,<delimiter>because we don’t worship Satan as our god,<delimiter>because we walk in light and not in darkness.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(excitedly)<delimiter>“Because you walk in light, and not in darkness”,<delimiter>so throw away obedience and patience,<delimiter>like a mime’s mask, just rip it off your face,<delimiter>you don’t want to serve and to obey<delimiter>him whose dark power your souls no longer<delimiter>can tolerate, and against whom you must<delimiter>fight valiantly, as your conscience bids you!<delimiter>Did I correctly understand you, father?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Yes, that’s correct, but I must add one thing:<delimiter>we struggle while we’re patient and obedient.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>(in a fallen voice)<delimiter>Again I don’t understand a thing:<delimiter>to struggle while obedient—what is that?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>We fight against a spirit, and not people.<delimiter>Obediently we pay all our taxes,<delimiter>we honor Caesar and the government of Rome,<delimiter>we don’t rise up against them either in our words<delimiter>or deeds, and only to the Prince of Darkness<delimiter>do we refuse to sacrifice or bow.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>But what about Caesar and the state?<delimiter>Do they not serve the servants of that spirit<delimiter>whom you called Satan, or the Prince of Darkness?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>While they are serving idols. Other times<delimiter>they are our leaders, sent to us by God.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>By god? Which god?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>There is no god but God,<delimiter>there’s only one, the God who’s Word and Love.<delimiter>The Trinity: the Son, the Father, Spirit.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>So it was he who gave us Caesar and the state,<delimiter>the rule of the Praetorians, patricians,<delimiter>and ownership of slaves by wealthy people?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>“There is no authority except<delimiter>God-sanctioned in the world”. For God is king<delimiter>and lord over all the earthly rulers.<delimiter>They are in His hand; He will be the judge<delimiter>of their evil-doing, and not we.<delimiter>“Vengeance is mine”, said the Eternal One.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>When will it happen?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Who hath ever known<delimiter>Almighty’s mind?
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Perhaps one has to wait<delimiter>until the whole world becomes God’s Kingdom,<delimiter>or till the second coming of the Christ?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Then certainly the Judgment Day will come.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>And then what?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>We’ll become one happy herd,<delimiter>led by one shepherd.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Will this shepherd have<delimiter>assistants, representatives, or vicars<delimiter>to help him supervise and lead the people?<delimiter>And will the people no longer only<delimiter>be free inside, but really—still slaves?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>I don’t know, we don’t have a message<delimiter>regarding this from Jesus or apostles.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>O really?... As far as I’m concerned,<delimiter>God’s Kingdom doesn’t have to come!
The Old Slave<delimiter>(with unspeakable fear)<delimiter>Lord Jesus!<delimiter>Save us from sin, o God! What is he saying?
The entire Christian congregation begins to shout; we cannot hear separate words, but the volume is growing like a wave, gradually filling the crypt and echoing throughout the dark passages of the catacombs.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(raises his hand. In a powerful voice)<delimiter>Peace, brethren, unto you!<delimiter>(to The Neophyte Slave)<delimiter>repent, o sinner!<delimiter>Take back those reckless words before too late,<delimiter>or in the next world you will suffer worse<delimiter>than you’ve been suffering in this one. He who here<delimiter>does not strive for the world that is to come—<delimiter>will lose his precious place in God’s own kingdom<delimiter>and will be plunged into the vicious Hell,<delimiter>where there is ever-burning fire, cries and whimpers,<delimiter>where endless torture will consume your heart.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>No, I will not repent. You’re wasting time, old man:<delimiter>your hell won’t scare me. I live it every day.<delimiter>Each day, each hour, and every minute<delimiter>I hear moans, whimpers, lamentations,<delimiter>and each and every day my heart is tortured.<delimiter>It was that hell that brought me here to you<delimiter>in search of truth, of freedom, and of hope.<delimiter>And what did I discover? Just evasion<delimiter>and ethereal dreams of afterlife,<delimiter>presided by a three-personae ruler<delimiter>who lords it over all your mortal lords,<delimiter>while letting them be lords over us<delimiter>from the first coming to the second coming,<delimiter>and, possibly, beyond. Perhaps, when we have died,<delimiter>in that celestial god’s kingdom that you promise,<delimiter>it will forever be the way it’s here:<delimiter>incorporeal bodies will forever<delimiter>just suffer, only “struggle while obedient.”
This service spirit<delimiter>(points at the Old Slave)<delimiter>will keep serving even there,<delimiter>not just from fear—guided by conscience,<delimiter>the soul of his highness the patrician,<delimiter>this one<delimiter>(points at the merchant)<delimiter>will keep respecting good and evil<delimiter>and deal out purity, a little at a time,<delimiter>this one<delimiter>(points at the deacon)<delimiter>will serve, but only once a week,<delimiter>a fine spiritual meal to such riff-raff<delimiter>like me, for instance, while the rabble will<delimiter>just stand in silence, patient and obedient,<delimiter>like paupers in the presence of a lord,<delimiter>and wait: perhaps the priest will give a sign<delimiter>that we can make a sound, speak a word,<delimiter>or will command us to sing hymns<delimiter>of praise to the mighty king of kings<delimiter>and lord of all the slaves in heaven.<delimiter>In fact, I don’t know—would I rather<delimiter>forever suffer in the hell’s eternal fire<delimiter>or in that hopeless eternal bondage,<delimiter>from which not even death can set me free.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>(having already several times tried to interrupt and having stricken the ground with his cane, shouts over The Neophyte Slave in an angry and threatening voice)<delimiter>Scram, get thee hence, you foul son of darkness!<delimiter>Leave us immediately! What brought you here<delimiter>to tempt our devout congregation?<delimiter>Go slither back into the hole, child of the Echynda,<delimiter>from which you came to bring us to perdition!
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>No, you’ve got no right to chase me off,<delimiter>because you are the one who got me here,<delimiter>me, who believed you so naively,<delimiter>believed your promises of finding love and peace,<delimiter>and life eternal. Now you have taken<delimiter>the very last remainder of my peace,<delimiter>forever poisoned my last love, and now<delimiter>I feel my soul’s dying. For I didn’t know<delimiter>before what sin is, only that I suffered,—<delimiter>and you have taught me that I am unclean,<delimiter>a sinner before god. Before I was so certain<delimiter>that death will put and end to all my pain,—<delimiter>you told me: an eternal hell awaits<delimiter>forever, for the smallest of transgressions.<delimiter>So you have to grant me a defense<delimiter>against this multitude of hellish deadly sins.<delimiter>You taught me how I should love my neighbor,<delimiter>so teach me now how to defend them,<delimiter>and not to simply helplessly observe<delimiter>how my brother slaves are tortured and then perish.<delimiter>All your compassion—nothing but a patch<delimiter>on rotten rags of miserable living,<delimiter>and is accentuating daily torment.<delimiter>Will a wet nurse’s milk provide my child<delimiter>with mother’s love, with mother’s tender care?<delimiter>And will my daily violated wife<delimiter>get pure again from wearing clean clothes?<delimiter>Will I, among your happy congregation,<delimiter>be able to forget my sad, dejected home?<delimiter>It is not bread I want, not words that I desire,—<delimiter>I yearn for an unadulterated love,<delimiter>without envy and without dirty doubts,<delimiter>I’m thirsting for a bright and pure hope,<delimiter>that I will catch a glimpse of freedom from afar,<delimiter>or that my child, or grandchild, or descendant<delimiter>will see the time when slavery will die,<delimiter>when even the word “slave” will disappear;<delimiter>The holy force I crave belief in is the one<delimiter>that will illuminate the darkest minds<delimiter>and gather all in a community of freedom,<delimiter>without lords or shepherds-supervisors,<delimiter>and not a herd with a capricious pastor<delimiter>and vicious dogs—a herd forever trembling<delimiter>from noises made by wolves, by lions, jackals,<delimiter>hyenas—any carnivore in nature.<delimiter>I’m not the only one with this spiritual thirst,<delimiter>I’m not the only one whose heart is starving,<delimiter>There are a lot of us. A friend, another slave,<delimiter>told me the other day that by the Tiber,<delimiter>once you have crossed the poisonous Maremma,<delimiter>there is a secret camp of rebel slaves.<delimiter>They’ve had enough of always being slaves,<delimiter>and plan to tear their bonds asunder<delimiter>and throw off the yoke from their necks.
<b>The Patrician</b><delimiter>For how long, you think, they’ll to keep it off?
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>A single moment would be worth the trouble!<delimiter>I used to hoped for eternal freedom<delimiter>in your community, but you can’t remove,<delimiter>not even for a second, your “sweet yoke”.<delimiter>Instead of dreaming of eternal, it is better<delimiter>to act for temporary that can be achieved,<delimiter>exchange agape for a bloody orgy.
<b>The Patrician</b><delimiter>Or for ingloriously dying on a cross.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Hey, Christian folk, since when do you consider<delimiter>an execution an inglorious demise?<delimiter>You think I should be scared of the cross?<delimiter>Your Savior didn’t seem to feel ashamed<delimiter>of dying in the company of bandits<delimiter>on such a cross.
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>But He then made it holy,<delimiter>and not the bandits. Jesus saved those men,<delimiter>not the other way around.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>Are you certain?<delimiter>What if he owes ruling over Heaven,<delimiter>what if he owes lordship over souls<delimiter>to blood that’s spilled by revolutionaries, rebels,<delimiter>that terrifies all slaves and those “meek of spirit”,<delimiter>because, perhaps, both “patience and submission”<delimiter>would have long left this world without a trace,<delimiter>if we were not scared of a death in vain<delimiter>by visions of the bloodied outlaws<delimiter>who have been executed on the crosses.
<b>A Young Christian</b><delimiter>He who is patient and submissive fears not<delimiter>to die upon a cross for Him who suffered<delimiter>for us his Passions.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>So did he suffer<delimiter>for us so that we suffer yet again?<delimiter>Where is it, that salvation, where’s that redeeming<delimiter>of sins of the entire world, if once every day<delimiter>somebody once again must pay the price?
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>We’ll be redeemed not here, but in Heaven.<delimiter>Not of this world is our kingdom. Bodies—<delimiter>let bodies die, as long as souls live.<delimiter>Christ gave his own flesh, his own blood<delimiter>to nourish us, while lazy slaves—like you,<delimiter>for instance, squander this, so precious, present,<delimiter>so, thanks to you, it perishes for nothing.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>And how many slaves like me have perished,<delimiter>as bloody victims to unrighteous deities,<delimiter>and how many are still dying for that king,<delimiter>who, as you say, has sentenced us to slavery?<delimiter>Who’s measured the long way, all lined with crosses,<delimiter>That we, we slaves, for centuries have walked?<delimiter>Who has appraised the blood that’s yet to fall<delimiter>upon the heads of torturers, still weighing<delimiter>upon the kids of executed heroes?<delimiter>A phalanx of innumerable deities<delimiter>has walked over that blood—a crimson carpet<delimiter>rolled out for the triumph of a caesar—<delimiter>from heaven here. How long will they,<delimiter>incorporeal tyrants, bloodless ghosts,<delimiter>these lifeless apparitions, keep on treading<delimiter>this priceless scarlet way of living blood?<delimiter>As for my blood—I’ll never give a drop<delimiter>for blood of Christ. If it indeed is true<delimiter>that he is God, then, for a change, let God<delimiter>spill blood for us—that would be quite a first.<delimiter>I don’t care if there is but one God,<delimiter>or three, three hundred, or a whole horde.<delimiter>Not for a single one I want to die:<delimiter>not for a king who rules somewhere in Eden,<delimiter>not for the tyrants ruling from Olympus,—<delimiter>I won’t be a slave to either one,<delimiter>I’ve had enough of slavery right here!<delimiter>I will extoll Prometheus the titan,<delimiter>who did not make his humans to be slaves,<delimiter>who spread enlightenment with fire, not with word,<delimiter>who struggled violently and did not surrender,<delimiter>and suffered for an aeon, not three days,<delimiter>yet did not call his torturer his father,<delimiter>but an ignoble tyrant, whom he cursed,<delimiter>while prophesying death to all the gods.<delimiter>That’s whom I’ll follow. And if I should die,<delimiter>it won’t be for him—he doesn’t want it,—<delimiter>but for the same things that he suffered for.<delimiter>Let no one be scared of my cross,<delimiter>for if I feel a holy fire in my heart,<delimiter>and for an hour, or even for a moment<delimiter>will live not as a miserable slave,<delimiter>but as a soverign, unfettered demigod,<delimiter>then happily shall I face my demise,<delimiter>and calmly meet my end upon a cross.
Ancillodeia suddenly starts weeping uncontrollably.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>What happened, sister? Why are you upset?<delimiter>Did I say something inadvertently that hurt you?<delimiter>Believe me, I did not mean to offend you.
<b>Ancillodeia</b><delimiter>No, brother... that’s not it... just what a pity...<delimiter>I’m sorry for your fate... You probably will perish...
<b>The Bishop</b><delimiter>Don’t cry. He is not worthy of your tears.<delimiter>In his recalcitrance, Prometheus he worships,<delimiter>and that is Satan, the eternal serpent,<delimiter>who led us into sin, into defiance.<delimiter>There is no redemption for this slave,<delimiter>and no forgiveness. He has lost his soul.<delimiter>Let’s make sign of the cross and leave this sinner,<delimiter>Let’s distance ourselves from sin and evil.
<b>The Neophyte Slave</b><delimiter>And I will go fight against enslavement,<delimiter>for liberty and truth, against your falsehood!
The entire community moves out, carrying candles. The Bishop leads. The Neophyte Slave goes by himself into a different tunnel on the other side.

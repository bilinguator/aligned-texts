Lao Tzu
<h1>Tao Te Ching</h1>
<h1>1. The Way</h1>
The Way that can be experienced is not true;<delimiter>The world that can be constructed is not true.<delimiter>The Way manifests all that happens and may happen;<delimiter>The world represents all that exists and may exist.<delimiter>To experience without intention is to sense the world;<delimiter>To experience with intention is to anticipate the world.<delimiter>These two experiences are indistinguishable;<delimiter>Their construction differs but their effect is the same.<delimiter>Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,<delimiter>Which is ever greater and more subtle than the world.
<h1>2. Abstraction</h1>
When beauty is abstracted<delimiter>Then ugliness has been implied;<delimiter>When good is abstracted<delimiter>Then evil has been implied.<delimiter>So alive and dead are abstracted from nature,<delimiter>Difficult and easy abstracted from progress,<delimiter>Long and short abstracted from contrast,<delimiter>High and low abstracted from depth,<delimiter>Song and speech abstracted from melody,<delimiter>After and before abstracted from sequence.<delimiter>The sage experiences without abstraction,<delimiter>And accomplishes without action;<delimiter>He accepts the ebb and flow of things,<delimiter>Nurtures them, but does not own them,<delimiter>And lives, but does not dwell.
<h1>3. Without Action</h1>
Not praising the worthy prevents contention,<delimiter>Not esteeming the valuable prevents theft,<delimiter>Not displaying the beautiful prevents desire.<delimiter>In this manner the sage governs people:<delimiter>Emptying their minds,<delimiter>Filling their bellies,<delimiter>Weakening their ambitions,<delimiter>And strengthening their bones.<delimiter>If people lack knowledge and desire<delimiter>Then they can not act;<delimiter>If no action is taken<delimiter>Harmony remains.
<h1>4. Limitless</h1>
The Way is a limitless vessel;<delimiter>Used by the self, it is not filled by the world;<delimiter>It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;<delimiter>Its depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;<delimiter>I don’t know where it comes from;<delimiter>It comes before nature.
<h1>5. Nature</h1>
Nature is not kind;<delimiter>It treats all things impartially.<delimiter>The Sage is not kind,<delimiter>And treats all people impartially.<delimiter>Nature is like a bellows,<delimiter>Empty, yet never ceasing its supply.<delimiter>The more it moves, the more it yields;<delimiter>So the sage draws upon experience<delimiter>And cannot be exhausted.
<h1>6. Experience</h1>
Experience is a riverbed,<delimiter>Its source hidden, forever flowing:<delimiter>Its entrance, the root of the world,<delimiter>The Way moves within it:<delimiter>Draw upon it; it will not run dry.
<h1>7. Complete</h1>
Nature is complete because it does not serve itself.<delimiter>The sage places himself after and finds himself before,<delimiter>Ignores his desire and finds himself content.<delimiter>He is complete because he does not serve himself.
<h1>8. Water</h1>
The best of man is like water,<delimiter>Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,<delimiter>Which flows in places that others disdain,<delimiter>Where it is in harmony with the Way.<delimiter>So the sage:<delimiter>Lives within nature,<delimiter>Thinks within the deep,<delimiter>Gives within impartiality,<delimiter>Speaks within trust,<delimiter>Governs within order,<delimiter>Crafts within ability,<delimiter>Acts within opportunity.<delimiter>He does not contend, and none contend against him.
<h1>9. Retire</h1>
Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled;<delimiter>Temper a sword to its hardest and it is easily broken;<delimiter>Amass the greatest treasure and it is easily stolen;<delimiter>Claim credit and honour and you easily fall;<delimiter>Retire once your purpose is achieved — this is natural.
<h1>10. Harmony</h1>
Embracing the Way, you become embraced;<delimiter>Breathing gently, you become newborn;<delimiter>Clearing your mind, you become clear;<delimiter>Nurturing your children, you become impartial;<delimiter>Opening your heart, you become accepted;<delimiter>Accepting the world, you embrace the Way.<delimiter>Bearing and nurturing,<delimiter>Creating but not owning,<delimiter>Giving without demanding,<delimiter>This is harmony.
<h1>11. Tools</h1>
Thirty spokes meet at a nave;<delimiter>Because of the hole we may use the wheel.<delimiter>Clay is moulded into a vessel;<delimiter>Because of the hollow we may use the cup.<delimiter>Walls are built around a hearth;<delimiter>Because of the doors we may use the house.<delimiter>Thus tools come from what exists,<delimiter>But use from what does not.
<h1>12. Substance</h1>
Too much colour blinds the eye,<delimiter>Too much music deafens the ear,<delimiter>Too much taste dulls the palate,<delimiter>Too much play maddens the mind,<delimiter>Too much desire tears the heart.<delimiter>In this manner the sage cares for people:<delimiter>He provides for the belly, not for the senses;<delimiter>He ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.
<h1>13. Self</h1>
Both praise and blame cause concern,<delimiter>For they bring people hope and fear.<delimiter>The object of hope and fear is the self -<delimiter>For, without self, to whom may fortune and disaster occur?<delimiter>Therefore,<delimiter>Who distinguishes himself from the world may be given the world,<delimiter>But who regards himself as the world may accept the world.
<h1>14. Mystery</h1>
Looked at but cannot be seen — it is beneath form;<delimiter>Listened to but cannot be heard — it is beneath sound;<delimiter>Held but cannot be touched — it is beneath feeling;<delimiter>These depthless things evade definition,<delimiter>And blend into a single mystery.<delimiter>In its rising there is no light,<delimiter>In its falling there is no darkness,<delimiter>A continuous thread beyond description,<delimiter>Lining what can not occur;<delimiter>Its form formless,<delimiter>Its image nothing,<delimiter>Its name silence;<delimiter>Follow it, it has no back,<delimiter>Meet it, it has no face.<delimiter>Attend the present to deal with the past;<delimiter>Thus you grasp the continuity of the Way,<delimiter>Which is its essence.
<h1>15. Enlightenment</h1>
The enlightened possess understanding<delimiter>So profound they can not be understood.<delimiter>Because they cannot be understood<delimiter>I can only describe their appearance:<delimiter>Cautious as one crossing thin ice,<delimiter>Undecided as one surrounded by danger,<delimiter>Modest as one who is a guest,<delimiter>Unbounded as melting ice,<delimiter>Genuine as unshaped wood,<delimiter>Broad as a valley,<delimiter>Seamless as muddy water.<delimiter>Who stills the water that the mud may settle,<delimiter>Who seeks to stop that he may travel on,<delimiter>Who desires less than may transpire,<delimiter>Decays, but will not renew.
<h1>16. Decay and Renewal</h1>
Empty the self completely;<delimiter>Embrace perfect peace.<delimiter>The world will rise and move;<delimiter>Watch it return to rest.<delimiter>All the flourishing things<delimiter>Will return to their source.<delimiter>This return is peaceful;<delimiter>It is the flow of nature,<delimiter>An eternal decay and renewal.<delimiter>Accepting this brings enlightenment,<delimiter>Ignoring this brings misery.<delimiter>Who accepts nature’s flow becomes all-cherishing;<delimiter>Being all-cherishing he becomes impartial;<delimiter>Being impartial he becomes magnanimous;<delimiter>Being magnanimous he becomes natural;<delimiter>Being natural he becomes one with the Way;<delimiter>Being one with the Way he becomes immortal:<delimiter>Though his body will decay, the Way will not.
<h1>17. Rulers</h1>
The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;<delimiter>The next best are loved and praised;<delimiter>The next are feared;<delimiter>The next despised:<delimiter>They have no faith in their people,<delimiter>And their people become unfaithful to them.<delimiter>When the best rulers achieve their purpose<delimiter>Their subjects claim the achievement as their own.
<h1>18. Hypocrisy</h1>
When the Way is forgotten<delimiter>Duty and justice appear;<delimiter>Then knowledge and wisdom are born<delimiter>Along with hypocrisy.<delimiter>When harmonious relationships dissolve<delimiter>Then respect and devotion arise;<delimiter>When a nation falls to chaos<delimiter>Then loyalty and patriotism are born.
<h1>19. Simplify</h1>
If we could abolish knowledge and wisdom<delimiter>Then people would profit a hundredfold;<delimiter>If we could abolish duty and justice<delimiter>Then harmonious relationships would form;<delimiter>If we could abolish artifice and profit<delimiter>Then waste and theft would disappear.<delimiter>Yet such remedies treat only symptoms<delimiter>And so they are inadequate.<delimiter>People need personal remedies:<delimiter>Reveal your naked self and embrace your original nature;<delimiter>Bind your self-interest and control your ambition;<delimiter>Forget your habits and simplify your affairs.
<h1>20. Wandering</h1>
What is the difference between assent and denial?<delimiter>What is the difference between beautiful and ugly?<delimiter>What is the difference between fearsome and afraid?<delimiter>The people are merry as if at a magnificent party<delimiter>Or playing in the park at springtime,<delimiter>But I am tranquil and wandering,<delimiter>Like a newborn before it learns to smile,<delimiter>Alone, with no true home.<delimiter>The people have enough and to spare,<delimiter>Where I have nothing,<delimiter>And my heart is foolish,<delimiter>Muddled and cloudy.<delimiter>The people are bright and certain,<delimiter>Where I am dim and confused;<delimiter>The people are clever and wise,<delimiter>Where I am dull and ignorant;<delimiter>Aimless as a wave drifting over the sea,<delimiter>Attached to nothing.<delimiter>The people are busy with purpose,<delimiter>Where I am impractical and rough;<delimiter>I do not share the peoples’ cares<delimiter>But I am fed at nature’s breast.
<h1>21. Accept</h1>
Harmony is only in following the Way.<delimiter>The Way is without form or quality,<delimiter>But expresses all forms and qualities;<delimiter>The Way is hidden and implicate,<delimiter>But expresses all of nature;<delimiter>The Way is unchanging,<delimiter>But expresses all motion.<delimiter>Beneath sensation and memory<delimiter>The Way is the source of all the world.<delimiter>How can I understand the source of the world?<delimiter>By accepting.
<h1>22. Home</h1>
Accept and you become whole,<delimiter>Bend and you straighten,<delimiter>Empty and you fill,<delimiter>Decay and you renew,<delimiter>Want and you acquire,<delimiter>Fulfill and you become confused.<delimiter>The sage accepts the world<delimiter>As the world accepts the Way;<delimiter>He does not display himself, so is clearly seen,<delimiter>Does not justify himself, so is recognized,<delimiter>Does not boast, so is credited,<delimiter>Does not pride himself, so endures,<delimiter>Does not contend, so none contend against him.<delimiter>The ancients said, “Accept and you become whole”,<delimiter>Once whole, the world is as your home.
<h1>23. Words</h1>
Nature says only a few words:<delimiter>High wind does not last long,<delimiter>Nor does heavy rain.<delimiter>If nature’s words do not last<delimiter>Why should those of man?<delimiter>Who accepts harmony, becomes harmonious.<delimiter>Who accepts loss, becomes lost.<delimiter>For who accepts harmony, the Way harmonizes with him,<delimiter>And who accepts loss, the Way cannot find.
<h1>24. Indulgence</h1>
Straighten yourself and you will not stand steady;<delimiter>Display yourself and you will not be clearly seen;<delimiter>Justify yourself and you will not be respected;<delimiter>Promote yourself and you will not be believed;<delimiter>Pride yourself and you will not endure.<delimiter>These behaviours are wasteful, indulgent,<delimiter>And so they attract disfavour;<delimiter>Harmony avoids them.
<h1>25. Beneath Abstraction</h1>
There is a mystery,<delimiter>Beneath abstraction,<delimiter>Silent, depthless,<delimiter>Alone, unchanging,<delimiter>Ubiquitous and liquid,<delimiter>The mother of nature.<delimiter>It has no name, but I call it “the Way”;<delimiter>It has no limit, but I call it “limitless”.<delimiter>Being limitless, it flows away forever;<delimiter>Flowing away forever, it returns to my self:<delimiter>The Way is limitless,<delimiter>So nature is limitless,<delimiter>So the world is limitless,<delimiter>And so I am limitless.<delimiter>For I am abstracted from the world,<delimiter>The world from nature,<delimiter>Nature from the Way,<delimiter>And the Way from what is beneath abstraction.
<h1>26. Calm</h1>
Gravity is the source of lightness,<delimiter>Calm, the master of haste.<delimiter>A lone traveller will journey all day, watching over his belongings;<delimiter>Yet once safe in his bed he will lose them in sleep.<delimiter>The captain of a great vessel will not act lightly or hastily.<delimiter>Acting lightly, he loses sight of the world,<delimiter>Acting hastily, he loses control of himself.<delimiter>A captain can not treat his great ship as a small boat;<delimiter>Rather than glitter like jade<delimiter>He must stand like stone.
<h1>27. Perfection</h1>
The perfect traveller leaves no trail to be followed;<delimiter>The perfect speaker leaves no question to be answered;<delimiter>The perfect accountant leaves no working to be completed;<delimiter>The perfect container leaves no lock to be closed;<delimiter>The perfect knot leaves no end to be ravelled.<delimiter>So the sage nurtures all men<delimiter>And abandons no one.<delimiter>He accepts everything<delimiter>And rejects nothing.<delimiter>He attends to the smallest details.<delimiter>So the strong must guide the weak,<delimiter>For the weak are raw material to the strong.<delimiter>If the guide is not respected,<delimiter>Or the material is not cared for,<delimiter>Confusion will result, no matter how clever one is.<delimiter>This is the secret of perfection:<delimiter>When raw wood is carved, it becomes a tool;<delimiter>When a man is employed, he becomes a tool;<delimiter>The perfect carpenter leaves no wood to be carved.
<h1>28. Becoming</h1>
Using the male, being female,<delimiter>Being the entrance of the world,<delimiter>You embrace harmony<delimiter>And become as a newborn.<delimiter>Using strength, being weak,<delimiter>Being the root of the world,<delimiter>You complete harmony<delimiter>And become as unshaped wood.<delimiter>Using the light, being dark,<delimiter>Being the world,<delimiter>You perfect harmony<delimiter>And return to the Way.
<h1>29. Ambition</h1>
Those who wish to change the world<delimiter>According with their desire<delimiter>Cannot succeed.<delimiter>The world is shaped by the Way;<delimiter>It cannot be shaped by the self.<delimiter>Trying to change it, you damage it;<delimiter>Trying to possess it, you lose it.<delimiter>So some will lead, while others follow.<delimiter>Some will be warm, others cold<delimiter>Some will be strong, others weak.<delimiter>Some will get where they are going<delimiter>While others fall by the side of the road.<delimiter>So the sage will be neither wasteful nor violent.
<h1>30. Violence</h1>
Powerful men are well advised not to use violence,<delimiter>For violence has a habit of returning;<delimiter>Thorns and weeds grow wherever an army goes,<delimiter>And lean years follow a great war.<delimiter>A general is well advised<delimiter>To achieve nothing more than his orders:<delimiter>Not to take advantage of his victory.<delimiter>Nor to glory, boast or pride himself;<delimiter>To do what is dictated by necessity,<delimiter>But not by choice.<delimiter>For even the strongest force will weaken with time,<delimiter>And then its violence will return, and kill it.
<h1>31. Armies</h1>
Armies are tools of violence;<delimiter>They cause men to hate and fear.<delimiter>The sage will not join them.<delimiter>His purpose is creation;<delimiter>Their purpose is destruction.<delimiter>Weapons are tools of violence,<delimiter>Not of the sage;<delimiter>He uses them only when there is no choice,<delimiter>And then calmly, and with tact,<delimiter>For he finds no beauty in them.<delimiter>Whoever finds beauty in weapons<delimiter>Delights in the slaughter of men;<delimiter>And who delights in slaughter<delimiter>Cannot content himself with peace.<delimiter>So slaughters must be mourned<delimiter>And conquest celebrated with a funeral.
<h1>32. Shapes</h1>
The Way has no true shape,<delimiter>And therefore none can control it.<delimiter>If a ruler could control the Way<delimiter>All things would follow<delimiter>In harmony with his desire,<delimiter>And sweet rain would fall,<delimiter>Effortlessly slaking every thirst.<delimiter>The Way is shaped by use,<delimiter>But then the shape is lost.<delimiter>Do not hold fast to shapes<delimiter>But let sensation flow into the world<delimiter>As a river courses down to the sea.
<h1>33. Virtues</h1>
Who understands the world is learned;<delimiter>Who understands the self is enlightened.<delimiter>Who conquers the world has strength;<delimiter>Who conquers the self has harmony.<delimiter>Who is determined has purpose;<delimiter>Who is contented has wealth.<delimiter>Who defends his home may long endure;<delimiter>Who surrenders his home may long survive it.
<h1>34. Control</h1>
The Way flows and ebbs, creating and destroying,<delimiter>Implementing all the world, attending to the tiniest details,<delimiter>Claiming nothing in return.<delimiter>It nurtures all things,<delimiter>Though it does not control them;<delimiter>It has no intention,<delimiter>So it seems inconsequential.<delimiter>It is the substance of all things;<delimiter>Though it does not control them;<delimiter>It has no exception,<delimiter>So it seems all-important.<delimiter>The sage would not control the world;<delimiter>He is in harmony with the world.
<h1>35. Peace</h1>
If you offer music and food<delimiter>Strangers may stop with you;<delimiter>But if you accord with the Way<delimiter>All the people of the world will keep you<delimiter>In safety, health, community, and peace.<delimiter>The Way lacks art and flavour;<delimiter>It can neither be seen nor heard,<delimiter>But its benefit cannot be exhausted.
<h1>36. Opposition</h1>
To reduce someone’s influence, first expand it;<delimiter>To reduce someone’s force, first increase it;<delimiter>To overthrow someone, first exalt them;<delimiter>To take from someone, first give to them.<delimiter>This is the subtlety by which the weak overcome the strong:<delimiter>Fish should not leave their depths,<delimiter>And swords should not leave their scabbards.
<h1>37. Tranquillity</h1>
The Way takes no action, but leaves nothing undone.<delimiter>When you accept this<delimiter>The world will flourish,<delimiter>In harmony with nature.<delimiter>Nature does not possess desire;<delimiter>Without desire, the heart becomes quiet;<delimiter>In this manner the whole world is made tranquil.
<h1>38. Ritual</h1>
Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;<delimiter>Closely held beliefs are not easily released;<delimiter>So ritual enthralls generation after generation.<delimiter>Harmony does not care for harmony, and so is naturally attained;<delimiter>But ritual is intent upon harmony, and so can not attain it.<delimiter>Harmony neither acts nor reasons;<delimiter>Love acts, but without reason;<delimiter>Justice acts to serve reason;<delimiter>But ritual acts to enforce reason.<delimiter>When the Way is lost, there remains harmony;<delimiter>When harmony is lost, there remains love;<delimiter>When love is lost, there remains justice;<delimiter>But when justice is lost, there remains ritual.<delimiter>Ritual is the end of compassion and honesty,<delimiter>The beginning of confusion;<delimiter>Belief is a colourful hope or fear,<delimiter>The beginning of folly.<delimiter>The sage goes by harmony, not by hope;<delimiter>He dwells in the fruit, not the flower;<delimiter>He accepts substance, and ignores abstraction.
<h1>39. Support</h1>
In mythical times all things were whole:<delimiter>All the sky was clear,<delimiter>All the earth was stable,<delimiter>All the mountains were firm,<delimiter>All the riverbeds were full,<delimiter>All of nature was fertile,<delimiter>And all the rulers were supported.<delimiter>But, losing clarity, the sky tore;<delimiter>Losing stability, the earth split;<delimiter>Losing strength, the mountains sank;<delimiter>Losing water, the riverbeds cracked;<delimiter>Losing fertility, nature disappeared;<delimiter>And losing support, the rulers fell.<delimiter>Rulers depend upon their subjects,<delimiter>The noble depend upon the humble;<delimiter>So rulers call themselves orphaned, hungry and alone,<delimiter>To win the people’s support.
<h1>40. Motion and Use</h1>
The motion of the Way is to return;<delimiter>The use of the Way is to accept;<delimiter>All things come from the Way,<delimiter>And the Way comes from nothing.
<h1>41. Following</h1>
When the great man learns the Way, he follows it with diligence;<delimiter>When the common man learns the Way, he follows it on occasion;<delimiter>When the mean man learns the Way, he laughs out loud;<delimiter>Those who do not laugh, do not learn at all.<delimiter>Therefore it is said:<delimiter>Who understands the Way seems foolish;<delimiter>Who progresses on the Way seems to fail;<delimiter>Who follows the Way seems to wander.<delimiter>For the finest harmony appears plain;<delimiter>The brightest truth appears coloured;<delimiter>The richest character appears incomplete;<delimiter>The bravest heart appears meek;<delimiter>The simplest nature appears inconstant.<delimiter>The square, perfected, has no corner;<delimiter>Music, perfected, has no melody;<delimiter>Love, perfected, has no climax;<delimiter>Art, perfected, has no meaning.<delimiter>The Way can be neither sensed nor known:<delimiter>It transmits sensation and transcends knowledge.
<h1>42. Mind</h1>
The Way bears sensation,<delimiter>Sensation bears memory,<delimiter>Sensation and memory bear abstraction,<delimiter>And abstraction bears all the world;<delimiter>Each thing in the world bears feeling and doing,<delimiter>And, imbued with mind, harmony with the Way.<delimiter>As others have taught, so do I teach,<delimiter>“Who loses harmony opposes nature”;<delimiter>This is the root of my teaching.
<h1>43. Overcoming</h1>
Water overcomes the stone;<delimiter>Without substance it requires no opening;<delimiter>This is the benefit of taking no action.<delimiter>Yet benefit without action,<delimiter>And experience without abstraction,<delimiter>Are practiced by very few.
<h1>44. Contentment</h1>
Health or reputation: which is held dearer?<delimiter>Health or possessions: which has more worth?<delimiter>Profit or loss: which is more troublesome?<delimiter>Great love incurs great expense,<delimiter>And great riches incur great fear,<delimiter>But contentment comes at no cost;<delimiter>Who knows when to stop<delimiter>Does not continue into danger,<delimiter>And so may long endure.
<h1>45. Quiet</h1>
Great perfection seems incomplete,<delimiter>But does not decay;<delimiter>Great abundance seems empty,<delimiter>But does not fail.<delimiter>Great truth seems contradictory;<delimiter>Great cleverness seems stupid;<delimiter>Great eloquence seems awkward.<delimiter>As spring overcomes the cold,<delimiter>And autumn overcomes the heat,<delimiter>So calm and quiet overcome the world.
<h1>46. Horses</h1>
When a nation follows the Way,<delimiter>Horses bear manure through its fields;<delimiter>When a nation ignores the Way,<delimiter>Horses bear soldiers through its streets.<delimiter>There is no greater mistake than following desire;<delimiter>There is no greater disaster than forgetting contentment;<delimiter>There is no greater sickness than seeking attainment;<delimiter>But one who is content to satisfy his needs<delimiter>Finds that contentment endures.
<h1>47. Knowing</h1>
Without taking a step outdoors<delimiter>You know the whole world;<delimiter>Without taking a peep out the window<delimiter>You know the colour of the sky.<delimiter>The more you experience,<delimiter>The less you know.<delimiter>The sage wanders without knowing,<delimiter>Sees without looking,<delimiter>Accomplishes without acting.
<h1>48. Inaction</h1>
The follower of knowledge learns as much as he can every day;<delimiter>The follower of the Way forgets as much as he can every day.<delimiter>By attrition he reaches a state of inaction<delimiter>Wherein he does nothing, but nothing remains undone.<delimiter>To conquer the world, accomplish nothing;<delimiter>If you must accomplish something,<delimiter>The world remains beyond conquest.
<h1>49. People</h1>
The sage does not distinguish between himself and the world;<delimiter>The needs of other people are as his own.<delimiter>He is good to those who are good;<delimiter>He is also good to those who are not good,<delimiter>Thereby he is good.<delimiter>He trusts those who are trustworthy;<delimiter>He also trusts those who are not trustworthy,<delimiter>Thereby he is trustworthy.<delimiter>The sage lives in harmony with the world,<delimiter>And his mind is the world’s mind.<delimiter>So he nurtures the worlds of others<delimiter>As a mother does her children.
<h1>50. Death</h1>
Men flow into life, and ebb into death.<delimiter>Some are filled with life;<delimiter>Some are empty with death;<delimiter>Some hold fast to life, and thereby perish,<delimiter>For life is an abstraction.<delimiter>Those who are filled with life<delimiter>Need not fear tigers and rhinos in the wilds,<delimiter>Nor wear armour and shields in battle;<delimiter>The rhinoceros finds no place in them for its horn,<delimiter>The tiger no place for its claw,<delimiter>The soldier no place for a weapon,<delimiter>For death finds no place in them.
<h1>51. Nurture</h1>
The Way bears all things;<delimiter>Harmony nurtures them;<delimiter>Nature shapes them;<delimiter>Use completes them.<delimiter>Each follows the Way and honours harmony,<delimiter>Not by law,<delimiter>But by being.<delimiter>The Way bears, nurtures, shapes, completes,<delimiter>Shelters, comforts, and makes a home for them.<delimiter>Bearing without possessing,<delimiter>Nurturing without taming,<delimiter>Shaping without forcing,<delimiter>This is harmony.
<h1>52. Clarity</h1>
The origin of the world is its mother;<delimiter>Understand the mother, and you understand the child;<delimiter>Embrace the child, and you embrace the mother,<delimiter>Who will not perish when you die.<delimiter>Reserve your judgments and words<delimiter>And you maintain your influence;<delimiter>Speak your mind and take positions<delimiter>And nothing can save you.<delimiter>As observing detail is clarity,<delimiter>So maintaining flexibility is strength;<delimiter>Use the light but shed no light,<delimiter>So that you do yourself no harm,<delimiter>But embrace clarity.
<h1>53. Difficult Paths</h1>
With but a small understanding<delimiter>One may follow the Way like a main road,<delimiter>Fearing only to leave it;<delimiter>Following a main road is easy,<delimiter>Yet people delight in difficult paths.<delimiter>When palaces are kept up<delimiter>Fields are left to weeds<delimiter>And granaries empty;<delimiter>Wearing fine clothes,<delimiter>Bearing sharp swords,<delimiter>Glutting with food and drink,<delimiter>Hoarding wealth and possessions —<delimiter>These are the ways of theft,<delimiter>And far from the Way.
<h1>54. Cultivate Harmony</h1>
Cultivate harmony within yourself, and harmony becomes real;<delimiter>Cultivate harmony within your family, and harmony becomes fertile;<delimiter>Cultivate harmony within your community, and harmony becomes abundant;<delimiter>Cultivate harmony within your culture, and harmony becomes enduring;<delimiter>Cultivate harmony within the world, and harmony becomes ubiquitous.<delimiter>Live with a person to understand that person;<delimiter>Live with a family to understand that family;<delimiter>Live with a community to understand that community;<delimiter>Live with a culture to understand that culture;<delimiter>Live with the world to understand the world.<delimiter>How can I live with the world?<delimiter>By accepting.
<h1>55. Soft Bones</h1>
Who is filled with harmony is like a newborn.<delimiter>Wasps and snakes will not bite him;<delimiter>Hawks and tigers will not claw him.<delimiter>His bones are soft yet his grasp is sure,<delimiter>For his flesh is supple;<delimiter>His mind is innocent yet his body is virile,<delimiter>For his vigour is plentiful;<delimiter>His song is long-lasting yet his voice is sweet,<delimiter>For his grace is perfect.<delimiter>But knowing harmony creates abstraction,<delimiter>And following abstraction creates ritual.<delimiter>Exceeding nature creates calamity,<delimiter>And controlling nature creates violence.
<h1>56. Impartiality</h1>
Who understands does not preach;<delimiter>Who preaches does not understand.<delimiter>Reserve your judgments and words;<delimiter>Smooth differences and forgive disagreements;<delimiter>Dull your wit and simplify your purpose;<delimiter>Accept the world.<delimiter>Then,<delimiter>Friendship and enmity,<delimiter>Profit and loss,<delimiter>Honour and disgrace,<delimiter>Will not affect you;<delimiter>The world will accept you.
<h1>57. Conquer with Inaction</h1>
Do not control the people with laws,<delimiter>Nor violence nor espionage,<delimiter>But conquer them with inaction.<delimiter>For:<delimiter>The more morals and taboos there are,<delimiter>The more cruelty afflicts people;<delimiter>The more guns and knives there are,<delimiter>The more factions divide people;<delimiter>The more arts and skills there are,<delimiter>The more change obsoletes people;<delimiter>The more laws and taxes there are,<delimiter>The more theft corrupts people.<delimiter>Yet take no action, and the people nurture eachother;<delimiter>Make no laws, and the people deal fairly with eachother;<delimiter>Own no interest, and the people cooperate with eachother;<delimiter>Express no desire, and the people harmonize with eachother.
<h1>58. No End</h1>
When government is lazy and informal<delimiter>The people are kind and honest;<delimiter>When government is efficient and severe<delimiter>The people are discontented and deceitful.<delimiter>Good fortune follows upon disaster;<delimiter>Disaster lurks within good fortune;<delimiter>Who can say how things will end?<delimiter>Perhaps there is no end.<delimiter>Honesty is ever deceived;<delimiter>Kindness is ever seduced;<delimiter>Men have been like this for a long time.<delimiter>So the sage is firm but not cutting,<delimiter>Pointed but not piercing,<delimiter>Straight but not rigid,<delimiter>Bright but not blinding.
<h1>59. Restraint</h1>
Manage a great nation as you would cook a delicate fish.<delimiter>To govern men in accord with nature<delimiter>It is best to be restrained;<delimiter>Restraint makes agreement easy to attain,<delimiter>And easy agreement builds harmonious relationships;<delimiter>With sufficient harmony no resistance will arise;<delimiter>When no resistance arises, then you possess the heart of the nation,<delimiter>And when you possess the nation’s heart, your influence will long endure:<delimiter>Deeply rooted and firmly established.<delimiter>This is the method of far sight and long life.
<h1>60. Demons</h1>
When you use the Way to conquer the world,<delimiter>Your demons will lose their power to harm.<delimiter>It is not that they lose their power as such,<delimiter>But that they will not harm others;<delimiter>Because they will not harm others,<delimiter>You will not harm others:<delimiter>When neither you nor your demons can do harm,<delimiter>You will be at peace with them.
<h1>61. Submission</h1>
A nation is like a hierarchy, a marketplace, and a maiden.<delimiter>A maiden wins her husband by submitting to his advances;<delimiter>Submission is a means of union.<delimiter>So when a large country submits to a small country<delimiter>It will adopt the small country;<delimiter>When a small country submits to a large country<delimiter>It will be adopted by the large country;<delimiter>The one submits and adopts;<delimiter>The other submits and is adopted.<delimiter>It is in the interest of a large country to unite and gain service,<delimiter>And in the interest of a small country to unite and gain patronage;<delimiter>If both would serve their interests,<delimiter>Both must submit.
<h1>62. Sin</h1>
The Way is the fate of men,<delimiter>The treasure of the saint,<delimiter>And the refuge of the sinner.<delimiter>Fine words are often borrowed,<delimiter>And great deeds are often appropriated;<delimiter>Therefore, when a man falls, do not abandon him,<delimiter>And when a man gains power, do not honour him;<delimiter>Only remain impartial and show him the Way.<delimiter>Why should someone appreciate the Way?<delimiter>The ancients said, “By it, those who seek may easily find,<delimiter>And those who regret may easily absolve”<delimiter>So it is the most precious gift.
<h1>63. Difficulty</h1>
Practice no-action;<delimiter>Attend to do-nothing;<delimiter>Taste the flavorless,<delimiter>Magnify the small,<delimiter>Multiply the few,<delimiter>Return love for hate.<delimiter>Deal with the difficult while it is yet easy;<delimiter>Deal with the great while it is yet small;<delimiter>The difficult develops naturally from the easy,<delimiter>And the great from the small;<delimiter>So the sage, by dealing with the small,<delimiter>Achieves the great.<delimiter>Who finds it easy to promise finds it hard to be trusted;<delimiter>Who takes things lightly finds things difficult;<delimiter>The sage recognizes difficulty, and so has none.
<h1>64</h1>
<b>64a. Care at the Beginning</b><delimiter><delimiter>What lies still is easy to grasp;<delimiter>What lies far off is easy to anticipate;<delimiter>What is brittle is easy to shatter;<delimiter>What is small is easy to disperse.<delimiter>Yet a tree broader than a man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;<delimiter>A dam greater than a river can overflow starts with a clod of earth;<delimiter>A journey of a thousand miles begins at the spot under one’s feet.<delimiter>Therefore deal with things before they happen;<delimiter>Create order before there is confusion.<delimiter><delimiter><b>64b. Care at the End</b><delimiter><delimiter>He who acts, spoils;<delimiter>He who grasps, loses.<delimiter>People often fail on the verge of success;<delimiter>Take care at the end as at the beginning,<delimiter>So that you may avoid failure.<delimiter>The sage desires no-desire,<delimiter>Values no-value,<delimiter>Learns no-learning,<delimiter>And returns to the places that people have forgotten;<delimiter>He would help all people to become natural,<delimiter>But then he would not be natural.
<h1>65. Subtlety</h1>
The ancients did not seek to rule people with knowledge,<delimiter>But to help them become natural.<delimiter>It is difficult for knowledgeable people to become natural;<delimiter>So to use law to control a nation weakens the nation,<delimiter>But to use nature to control a nation strengthens the nation.<delimiter>Understanding these two paths is understanding subtlety;<delimiter>Subtlety runs deep, ranges wide,<delimiter>Resolves confusion and preserves peace.
<h1>66. Lead by Following</h1>
The river carves out the valley by flowing beneath it.<delimiter>Thereby the river is the master of the valley.<delimiter>In order to master people<delimiter>One must speak as their servant;<delimiter>In order to lead people<delimiter>One must follow them.<delimiter>So when the sage rises above the people,<delimiter>They do not feel oppressed;<delimiter>And when the sage stands before the people,<delimiter>They do not feel hindered.<delimiter>So the popularity of the sage does not fail,<delimiter>He does not contend, and no one contends against him.
<h1>67. Unimportance</h1>
All the world says,<delimiter>“I am important;<delimiter>I am separate from all the world.<delimiter>I am important because I am separate,<delimiter>Were I the same, I could never be important.”<delimiter>Yet here are three treasures<delimiter>That I cherish and commend to you:<delimiter>The first is compassion,<delimiter>By which one finds courage.<delimiter>The second is restraint,<delimiter>By which one finds strength.<delimiter>And the third is unimportance,<delimiter>By which one finds influence.<delimiter>Those who are fearless, but without compassion,<delimiter>Powerful, but without restraint,<delimiter>Or influential, yet important,<delimiter>Cannot endure.
<h1>68. Compassion</h1>
Compassion is the finest weapon and best defence.<delimiter>If you would establish harmony,<delimiter>Compassion must surround you like a fortress.<delimiter>Therefore,<delimiter>A good soldier does not inspire fear;<delimiter>A good fighter does not display aggression;<delimiter>A good conqueror does not engage in battle;<delimiter>A good leader does not exercise authority.<delimiter>This is the value of unimportance;<delimiter>This is how to win the cooperation of others;<delimiter>This to how to build the same harmony that is in nature.
<h1>69. Ambush</h1>
There is a saying among soldiers:<delimiter>It is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.<delimiter>In this manner one may deploy troops without marshalling them,<delimiter>Bring weapons to bear without exposing them,<delimiter>Engage the foe without invading them,<delimiter>And exhaust their strength without fighting them.<delimiter>There is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;<delimiter>To do so endangers all of my treasures;<delimiter>So when two well matched forces oppose eachother,<delimiter>The general who maintains compassion will win.
<h1>70. Individuality</h1>
My words are easy to understand<delimiter>And my actions are easy to perform<delimiter>Yet no other can understand or perform them.<delimiter>My words have meaning; my actions have reason;<delimiter>Yet these cannot be known and I cannot be known.<delimiter>We are each unique, and therefore valuable;<delimiter>Though the sage wears coarse clothes, his heart is jade.
<h1>71. Limitation</h1>
Who recognizes his limitations is healthy;<delimiter>Who ignores his limitations is sick.<delimiter>The sage recognizes this sickness as a limitation.<delimiter>And so becomes immune.
<h1>72. Revolution</h1>
When people have nothing more to lose,<delimiter>Then revolution will result.<delimiter>Do not take away their lands,<delimiter>And do not destroy their livelihoods;<delimiter>If your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk it.<delimiter>The sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,<delimiter>Values himself but requires no honours;<delimiter>He ignores abstraction and accepts substance.
<h1>73. Fate</h1>
Who is brave and bold will perish;<delimiter>Who is brave and subtle will benefit.<delimiter>The subtle profit where the bold perish<delimiter>For fate does not honour daring.<delimiter>And even the sage dares not tempt fate.<delimiter>Fate does not attack, yet all things are conquered by it;<delimiter>It does not ask, yet all things answer to it;<delimiter>It does not call, yet all things meet it;<delimiter>It does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.<delimiter>Fate’s net is vast and its mesh is coarse,<delimiter>Yet none escape it.
<h1>74. Execution</h1>
If people were not afraid of death,<delimiter>Then what would be the use of an executioner?<delimiter>If people were only afraid of death,<delimiter>And you executed everyone who did not obey,<delimiter>No one would dare to disobey you.<delimiter>Then what would be the use of an executioner?<delimiter>People fear death because death is an instrument of fate.<delimiter>When people are killed by execution rather than by fate,<delimiter>This is like carving wood in the place of a carpenter.<delimiter>Those who carve wood in place of a carpenter<delimiter>Often injure their hands.
<h1>75. Rebellion</h1>
When rulers take grain so that they may feast,<delimiter>Their people become hungry;<delimiter>When rulers take action to serve their own interests,<delimiter>Their people become rebellious;<delimiter>When rulers take lives so that their own lives are maintained,<delimiter>Their people no longer fear death.<delimiter>When people act without regard for their own lives<delimiter>They overcome those who value only their own lives.
<h1>76. Flexibility</h1>
A newborn is soft and tender,<delimiter>A crone, hard and stiff.<delimiter>Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;<delimiter>In death, withered and dry.<delimiter>So softness and tenderness are attributes of life,<delimiter>And hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.<delimiter>Just as a sapless tree will split and decay<delimiter>So an inflexible force will meet defeat;<delimiter>The hard and mighty lie beneath the ground<delimiter>While the tender and weak dance on the breeze above.
<h1>77. Need</h1>
Is the action of nature not unlike drawing a bow?<delimiter>What is higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;<delimiter>What is taller is shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;<delimiter>Nature’s motion decreases those who have more than they need<delimiter>And increases those who need more than they have.<delimiter>It is not so with Man.<delimiter>Man decreases those who need more than they have<delimiter>And increases those who have more than they need.<delimiter>To give away what you do not need is to follow the Way.<delimiter>So the sage gives without expectation,<delimiter>Accomplishes without claiming credit,<delimiter>And has no desire for ostentation.
<h1>78. Yielding</h1>
Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water,<delimiter>Yet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,<delimiter>For they can neither control nor do away with it.<delimiter>The soft overcomes the hard,<delimiter>The yielding overcomes the strong;<delimiter>Every person knows this,<delimiter>But no one can practice it.<delimiter>Who attends to the people would control the land and grain;<delimiter>Who attends to the state would control the whole world;<delimiter>Truth is easily hidden by rhetoric.
<h1>79. Reconciliation</h1>
When conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;<delimiter>This is dangerous.<delimiter>The sage accepts less than is due<delimiter>And does not blame or punish;<delimiter>For harmony seeks agreement<delimiter>Where justice seeks payment.<delimiter>The ancients said: “nature is impartial;<delimiter>Therefore it serves those who serve all.”
<h1>80. Utopia</h1>
Let your community be small, with only a few people;<delimiter>Keep tools in abundance, but do not depend upon them;Appreciate your life and be content with your home;<delimiter>Sail boats and ride horses, but don’t go too far;<delimiter>Keep weapons and armour, but do not employ them;<delimiter>Let everyone read and write,<delimiter>Eat well and make beautiful things.<delimiter>Live peacefully and delight in your own society;<delimiter>Dwell within cock-crow of your neighbours,<delimiter>But maintain your independence from them.<delimiter>
<h1>81. The Sage</h1>
Honest people use no rhetoric;<delimiter>Rhetoric is not honesty.<delimiter>Enlightened people are not cultured;<delimiter>Culture is not enlightenment.<delimiter>Content people are not rich;<delimiter>Riches are not contentment.<delimiter>So the sage does not serve himself;<delimiter>The more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;<delimiter>The more he gives, the more he receives.<delimiter>Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;<delimiter>So the sage benefits all men and contends with none.

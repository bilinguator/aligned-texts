<h1>The Seasons</h1><delimiter>Translated from Lithuanian by Nadas Rastenis.
<h1>Joys of Spring</h1>
The climbing sun again was wakening the world<delimiter>And laughing at the wreck of frigid winter’s trade.<delimiter>The icy season’s grip was thouroughly undone,<delimiter>And heaps of high-piled snow had dwindled down to naught.<delimiter>Each day a soft south breeze caressed the barren fields<delimiter>And coaxed each blade and leaf to rise again and live.<delimiter>Each hill and dale had cast away the snowy furs;<delimiter>The bush and heath were glad to heed the springtime’s call.<delimiter>All things that died away in tearful autumn’s mire,<delimiter>All things that lay in sleep beneath the winter’s ice,<delimiter>Or huddled shivering under a stunted bush,<delimiter>Crept out in joyous throngs to hail the smiling spring.
The rats and skunks came forth from secret holes and nooks<delimiter>Crows, ravens, magpies, owls sailed on from bough to bough.<delimiter>Mice, moldwarps and their young, acclaimed the glowing warmth<delimiter>The countless flies and bugs, mosquitos, gnats and fleas.<delimiter>In ever growing swarms were rallying each day<delimiter>And gaping all around to sting the rich and poor.<delimiter>The queen bee, too, called forth her subjects to the task,<delimiter>Commanding them to start again upon their work.<delimiter>Soon endless swarms of them began to buzz and zoom,<delimiter>Afifing merry tunes and flying far and wide;<delimiter>Secluded in the nooks, lean spiders spun their threads,<delimiter>Or, scaling up and down, stretched long entrapping nets.<delimiter>Even the wolves and bears at the green forest’s edge<delimiter>Hunted in joyous mood for some unwary game.
It was a wondrous thing, that in the endless flock<delimiter>Of warblers that came here, there was no bird that wept.<delimiter>No, not to weep, but to rejoice they all came here.<delimiter>For now the winter’s chills and frosts were at an end,<delimiter>And the enchanting spring wrought wonders ev’rywhere.<delimiter>Ah, now in ev’ry place new life was all athrob;<delimiter>The air was filled with tunes of songsters on the wing.<delimiter>Some sang in lower key, some soared to heights of tone;<delimiter>Some flew far, far above, up to the silv’ry clouds;<delimiter>Some on a low bough perched — and all of them praised God.<delimiter>As yet the food was scarce, but none of them complained.<delimiter>Some had returned in worn and shabby feathered garb,<delimiter>Some carried back a maimed or broken wing or crest;<delimiter>Though in the fields they found but little sustenance,<delimiter>They did not grieve and no heart-breaking tears were shed;<delimiter>They all joyfully sang their merry melodies.
Along with them the stork came back to our fair land,<delimiter>And, husbandlike, atop the roof displayed his voice.<delimiter>While he gazed and rejoiced, his sweet and loving spouse<delimiter>Appeared upon the sill in gay and joyful mood<delimiter>And met her gentle mate with glad and gleaming beak.<delimiter>They found the old thatch roof much damaged and despoiled;<delimiter>And even their abode, built but a year ago,<delimiter>Was weather-beaten, bent, and sagging on each side.<delimiter>The very walls and beams and sturdy parapets<delimiter>Were torn and blown away by the relentless gales.<delimiter>Doors wrecked, sills fallen off, and ev’ry window gone:<delimiter>The northern wrath had wrought its havoc on their home.<delimiter>And so they both at once, as good homemakers should,<delimiter>With courage and in faith began to build again.<delimiter>The husband fetched great loads of branches, rods, and twigs<delimiter>With which his spouse patched up their home to suit her taste.<delimiter>And when their long and hard repairs were fully done<delimiter>The two of them flew off to a green marsh nearby;<delimiter>Then having caught and gorged some fatter frogs and toads<delimiter>Together gratefully they gave their thanks to God!<delimiter>You too, o futile man, be thankful and content:<delimiter>Since you far better fare, fail not to thank your God!
Bush, forest, grove and hurst resounded with sweet song;<delimiter>Green fields and meadows rang with mingling melodies.<delimiter>The cuckoo and the thrush sang their most joyous songs<delimiter>That gave glad, grateful praise to the Eternal Lord.<delimiter>Light-winged swallows rose beyond the distant clouds,<delimiter>Like speedy bullets shot up through the stilly air.<delimiter>Then having eaten their ungarnished victuals,<delimiter>Took once again to wing and caroled their glad tale.<delimiter>The crane kept circling high amidst the milky clouds<delimiter>And filling all the skies with melancholy song;<delimiter>But yet he neither cried nor clamored in the heights.<delimiter>No, he just told the world that God’s majestic will<delimiter>Is wondrous even in the gleeful voice of birds.<delimiter>The sparrows and their young chirped with the feathered throng:<delimiter>“Our generation, too, sings praise to the Lord God.”
The nightingale alone was hiding cleverly,<delimiter>Waiting till all the flocks had sung their daily song.<delimiter>Each year the last to start her mellow melodies,<delimiter>Each night she starts to chirp when we are wrapped in sleep,<delimiter>And then all by herself sings eulogies to God.<delimiter>Oft at the very dawn, even before we rise,<delimiter>Her song enlivens us and gladdens our sad hearts.<delimiter>O kind and loving God, how wondrous is Thy care!<delimiter>When we in frigid days seek shelter from harsh winds<delimiter>Atop a blazing stove and dream vain dreams, and snore,<delimiter>Then even you, dear bird, do not abide with us,<delimiter>But hide all by yourself in some remote retreat<delimiter>Perhaps adreaming that you catch your foolish flies.<delimiter>But now when we salute the happy days of spring,<delimiter>When we are all well set to cultivate our fields,<delimiter>You, too, resort to your high-toned nocturnal song,<delimiter>And with your ever sweet and merry scales and trills<delimiter>Make all our burdens light and urge us to rejoice.
But say, O queen of song, why do you always hide,<delimiter>And only late at night resort to your sweet tunes?<delimiter>Pray, why do you secrete yourself with your refrain?<delimiter>All souls, the bending poor and the parading rich —<delimiter>The youngsters of light heart and the dejected old —<delimiter>Each one and all admire your soul-entrancing song<delimiter>When you sing your sweet airs, O happy nightingale.<delimiter>You put to scorn the sound of organ, lute and lyre,<delimiter>You still in shame the notes of violin and harp,<delimiter>When you in glory raise your charming voice and cry,<delimiter>“Jurgut, be good! Wake up, hitch up your steed and speed!
As at the twilight you in hiding start to laugh,<delimiter>While we, all bent and worn, fall fast into our beds,<delimiter>Then you among the birds reign like a lovely queen,<delimiter>And your melodic strains grow evermore superb;<delimiter>But when at times we catch a glimpse of your attire,<delimiter>Then you appear to be a homely sparrow’s mate.<delimiter>You scorn the regal robes, despise resplendent gowns;<delimiter>You shun the silken dress and all the gaudy styles.<delimiter>Clad in a boorish garb, you sing your song divine.<delimiter>And so it often is in this, the life of men,<delimiter>When we stop to observe this everchanging world.
Take Diksas, that sluggard, displaying city airs;<delimiter>Attired in foppish clothes, he treads the village streets,<delimiter>And struts among the boors like some rare demigod.<delimiter>But when at times we chance to hear him speak his mind,<delimiter>Then e’en a simple boor must spit to hide a blush;<delimiter>And all the more when he proceeds to scorn the Lord —<delimiter>And with each utterance displays his ignorance.<delimiter>But now take Krizas, that bast-shod submissive soul,<delimiter>Clad in an awkward garb of homespun fashioning:<delimiter>In his small cottage, he sings like a nightingale,<delimiter>When he wholeheartedly gives praise to the Lord God.
You, O beloved bird, never eat fancy foods.<delimiter>You care not for our pork and spicy sausages.<delimiter>You have no taste for cooked and seasoned soups and broths;<delimiter>You care not for sweet cakes and fancy rolls and buns,<delimiter>Nor care for bracing mead or stupifying wine.<delimiter>Fed on the simple meals, you drink from a cool brook.<delimiter>But as you sing, dear bird, do not neglect your meals.<delimiter>Be brave and never skimp; eat any noisy thing.<delimiter>Eat, if you will, to your good health, that piebald bug.<delimiter>Eat lady beetles, vain grasshoppers and mean flies;<delimiter>Eat ever crawling ants and all their unborn breed.<delimiter>And when you reach our grove, pray, then remember us,<delimiter>As you keep singing through the happy summer nights<delimiter>And call, “Jurgut, be good! Hitch up your steed and speed!”
Here you, O futile man, must learn to be content.<delimiter>Although you oftentimes subsist on scanty meals,<delimiter>Mark how the songsters fare: one gnaws a slimy worm,<delimiter>Another, lacking grain, chews a beweathered weed.<delimiter>Arriving here each year to visit us, they too<delimiter>Find bleak and barren fields, with naught on which to live;<delimiter>And yet they never make the slightest of complaints.<delimiter>To you, O man, the Lord has given more than much,<delimiter>And yet you grumble if at times your meals are lean,<delimiter>Or solid food is scarce, or if your soup is thin.
As the birds sang and laughed, a hum of wings arose,<delimiter>And a large eagle soon appeared above the trees.<delimiter>“Hush, hush, you flocks,” quoth he, “keep still and cease your talk!<delimiter>Pay strict attention to what we will tell you now.”<delimiter>At once the feathered folk responded to the call,<delimiter>Convening in one spot and shouting in one voice:<delimiter>“We’re here, your Majesty! Pray, how we may serve you?<delimiter>The Eagle said: “We wish to hold an inquiry,<delimiter>As to how ye, my flocks, fared this long winter past.<delimiter>Had ye enough of food? Who died and who survived?<delimiter>Was any one killed by a skunk or a marten?<delimiter>Perhaps someone was snatched by an owl or a hawk?<delimiter>Has that foe, man, shot down some poor liegeman of ours,<delimiter>Or sneakingly captured one by a wing alive,<delimiter>And then, to stuff himself, the glutton, fried the wretch?”
As thus the eagle spoke and questioned poignantly,<delimiter>A husky stork arose, stretched out like a high lord,<delimiter>Bowed low, then bowed again, and then went on to say:<delimiter>“When God created and arranged this restless world,<delimiter>He sent forth endless scores of different living things,<delimiter>And to each He assigned his own life, food, and task,<delimiter>And made arrangements of astounding wonderment.<delimiter>Some of the flocks He sent to swim in lakes and seas,<delimiter>To others He gave wings to flutter in the air.<delimiter>Some living things He placed within the endless woods,<delimiter>And others He sent out to roam the fields and meads,<delimiter>Or to pule, quack or moo within some man’s back yard.<delimiter>And He provides and cares for ev’ry flock and herd.
“At times befalls to us a harsh and hungry day,<delimiter>When stormy gales sweep by, and drenching torrents fall —<delimiter>When for the sins of men God punishes the world.<delimiter>And man, that heartless foe, oft terrifies us all,<delimiter>As he garrotes and kills our lean and luckless kin.<delimiter>At times he steals the young from the parental nest,<delimiter>And oft he climbs a tree and kills the family.<delimiter>At times he to the flocks, like a benignant soul,<delimiter>Throws by a fence some grain and urges them to eat;<delimiter>But when someone of us finds courage to advance,<delimiter>Then he ensnares the wretch in his entrapping net,<delimiter>Or with his loaded gun just aims, and shoots, and kills.
“But e’en among the birds there are some crafty cheats,<delimiter>Who to have tasty food slay their own kind and kin.<delimiter>That nasty thug, the hawk, and his mentor, the owl —<delimiter>The ravens and the crows, and their pals, the magpies —<delimiter>As we know, ev’ry year kill many wretched birds.<delimiter>But among us we have no such a murderer<delimiter>As that sly thing who gapes to gorge fresh meats: the man.”
As this discourse went on, a strange event took place.<delimiter>As if someone were hurt or drowning in a lake,<delimiter>“Help, help! Oh, quickly help!” a shrieking voice cried out.<delimiter>Such urgent calls for aid upset the flock so much,<delimiter>That e’en the eagle brave could not move, stir, or budge.<delimiter>‘Twas but the bullhead bat and the intriguer owl<delimiter>Who gathered needed strength to lift an active wing<delimiter>And to investigate what trouble had occured.
A stocky gentleman, well drest — ’tis shame to say —<delimiter>A nobleman, at that, much overstuffed with food<delimiter>And oversoaked with wine imported from abroad,<delimiter>Was rolling on his floor and cursing terribly.<delimiter>By his unholy words he had called forth vast hordes<delimiter>Of fiends and demons and the sight of them caused him<delimiter>To scream so loudly that even the very hell<delimiter>And its entire domain began to steam and quake.<delimiter>We all know but to well how loud the rich can curse;<delimiter>But now from them the boors have learned to shout and swear.
“What ails you, you poor wretch?” the bat inquired of him,<delimiter>Eyeing the drunken lord and scorning him at once.<delimiter>“Have you a belly-ache from too much caviar?<delimiter>Perhaps the roasts and steaks are ripping your insides?<delimiter>As they your uncle’s did, two years ago, you know,<delimiter>When he and his cousin ate till their bellies ached,<delimiter>And their intestines burst, and they died in great pain.”
The bellied gentleman, hearing these truthful words,<delimiter>Swelled like a maniac bereft of reasoning.<delimiter>He pulled his rumpled hair from his unbalanced head,<delimiter>Tore off a piece of beard from his protruding chin,<delimiter>And with his fingernails he clawed his bloated face.<delimiter>But that was not the end. While searching for his cash<delimiter>And kicking, he upset the table and the food.<delimiter>Soon dogs from all around rushed in in pairs and packs,<delimiter>And gorged the fancy food and juncy steaks and roasts.<delimiter>But he went further still: seized a sharp carving knife,<delimiter>And put the gleaming blade against his fatty throat.<delimiter>By now the bat’s strong heart was more than much undone,<delimiter>So that his fibered wings lacked energy to stir.<delimiter>The owl, too, was unnerved by this blood-curdling sight,<delimiter>But managed to dart out from the infernal house;<delimiter>And that bird ever since this sad and haunting tale,<delimiter>Like some event of note, each night tells to the world,<delimiter>And laments in the dark for that bedeviled soul.
“Ah, listen,” spoke up Lauras leaning on his club,<delimiter>“What of it if some fools, along with Bleberis,<delimiter>Blab that the rich but drink each day and know no pain,<delimiter>And that the townsfolk dance each night and know no grief?<delimiter>Such blabbers at the sight of looming palaces<delimiter>And rolling carriages, the downfall of the rich,<delimiter>Think that each idler, dressed in trimmed and tailored clothes,<delimiter>Each day lives happily like an angel in heav’n.<delimiter>But friend, Lithuanians are crafty philosophers:<delimiter>They speak not of such things as they cook their groats hash<delimiter>And fashion new bast shoes for work and visiting.
“Yea; it is silly, when young Milkus, the valet<delimiter>Of Kasparas, each day stoops low before the rich,<delimiter>And scorns the simple boors as good-for-nothing trash.<delimiter>Say, Milkus, you dumb wretch, why do you raise your nose?<delimiter>Have you forgotten that a year ago you were<delimiter>Employed by Bleberis as a mere swineherd’s help,<delimiter>And bast-shod, like a dolt, performed mean feudal tasks?<delimiter>Don’t you recall the time when Prickus, properly,<delimiter>For harrowing not done, lashed well your bare behind?<delimiter>Recall how your father, shoe cobbler as he was,<delimiter>So oft would beat your back with a shoemaker’s last,<delimiter>And how your mother used to pull your loppy ears?<delimiter>And now you, like a prince, hold high your brainless head<delimiter>And grumble if at times a peasant passing by<delimiter>Fails to see the bright sword protruding from your belt,<delimiter>And does not lift his cap as soon as you expect,<delimiter>Or bows not before you as you think he should do.
“Go on, you snot; first learn how to warm up a stove<delimiter>And how to scrub and shine your master’s dirty boots.<delimiter>You know full well that he regards you as a fool,<delimiter>And plys your lazy back with his thick walking cane.<delimiter>As yet you have not learned to pour your master’s tea,<delimiter>Go, put on your bast shoes; go back to Bleberis<delimiter>And hear again how his lean pigs and hungry goats,<delimiter>Agazing through the cracks, cry sadly for some food.<delimiter>Why did you run away forsaking his young pigs?<delimiter>Did not old Bleberis take care of all your needs?<delimiter>While herding in his fields, were you not fed and clad?<delimiter>He took you in without a stitch upon your back;<delimiter>Each day a lot of lice he combed out of your hair,<delimiter>Until you learned to count the five pigs that he had.<delimiter>Indeed, you caused much grief and woe to Bleberis<delimiter>Ere you could take beyond the gate his only shoat<delimiter>And his four sows to join the herders in the field.<delimiter>And now you even down the home of Bleberis<delimiter>And slur his worthy name with insensate remarks?<delimiter>Just wait, you brainless snort; your luck may change again,<delimiter>And then once more you will be forced to beg for alms!”
Quote Prickus, “A young man, meseems, is but a fool<delimiter>Who quakes like mercury within a hollow flask,<delimiter>And by his restlessness brings harm unto himself.<delimiter>We too, when we were but snotnosed, unruly brats,<delimiter>Engaged in stupid things, and played our silly games.<delimiter>We boys oft gathered in the yards and village streets<delimiter>And there resorted to all kinds of tricks and pranks.<delimiter>There some of us would ride on homemade brooms and sticks,<delimiter>Headforemost galloping through the high-splashing mud,<delimiter>While others, pantless ones, would crack their whizzing whips —<delimiter>Roll, dance, play ‘hide and seek,’ and scurry to and fro;<delimiter>Meanwhile the little girls, themselves but baby-dolls,<delimiter>Would fashion baby-dolls of hurden rags and clouts,<delimiter>And leaning on their elbows worship bastard babes.<delimiter>Yes, thus the youngsters spend their happy summer days.<delimiter>The children of the rich join with the village kids;<delimiter>Fraternally they play together in the mud —<delimiter>And over and again say selfsame silly things.<delimiter>The children of the rich, too, get their bottoms spanked,<delimiter>When they, like others, wet their silken featherbeds.
“I fetched to Kasparas a letter days ago;<delimiter>At his high gate with cap in hand I stood a while<delimiter>Awaiting till someone would usher me inside.<delimiter>A woman came out of the manor running fast.<delimiter>‘Say, Gryta,’ I exclaimed, ‘What’s wrong? Why do you run?’<delimiter>‘Oh,’ curtly she replied, ‘Our master, the dear boy…’<delimiter>Having said this, she ran towards the river bank,<delimiter>And there she washed and scrubbed the lad’s unclean new pants.<delimiter>As there I stood and blushed, old Krizas came along.<delimiter>‘Say, friend,’ I said to him, ‘What do you think of that?<delimiter>Do not our silly tots do selfsame naughty things?’
‘The boorish women wrap their dolls in swaddling rags<delimiter>And stick them in the crib, down in the corners dark.<delimiter>Of course, you know full well how boors bring up their young.<delimiter>The ladies of high birth have their dolls drest in silk<delimiter>To lay to sleep in lace and satin featherbeds;<delimiter>But even their nice dolls, when their pink tummies ache,<delimiter>Blurt, blabber, belch and brawl, like our own boorish tots.<delimiter>And so ’tis ev’rywhere, while babes grow in this world,<delimiter>Sweet smiles and bitter tears remain their foremost trade.<delimiter>No one as yet grew up just smiling all the while,<delimiter>And no one left his crib without shedding a tear.’
“And now just look around, by God’s eternal will<delimiter>We sense the nearness of the balmy summer days.<delimiter>The reawakened soil reveals its fruitfulness;<delimiter>Each flower and each leaf sends forth a beaming smile.<delimiter>Behold, the birds up in the skies in streaming flocks<delimiter>Rejoice and intermingle, fly around and laugh,<delimiter>While other flocks lay eggs and count them in their nests.<delimiter>But wait you feathered folk until your gleaming eggs<delimiter>Shall peep and prove to be a lot of toil and grief,<delimiter>And then ungratefully will fly from you afar.<delimiter>The same lot that befalls the birds, befalls mankind,<delimiter>And no one can escape the troubles of this world.
“We too, ere learning to blab out the A B C,<delimiter>Have caused our parents much of worry and despair,<delimiter>Till we began to run around and play outside.<delimiter>Then just as soon as we began to gain some sense,<delimiter>Our tasks and miseries began to multiply,<delimiter>And all our toys and dolls appeared to us but trash.<delimiter>Indeed, things swiftly change when one has to put on<delimiter>A herder’s garments to pursue the herd afield,<delimiter>When drenching rains each day lash weak and weary backs.<delimiter>And too, when we must trail a harrow in a patch,<delimiter>Or urge the oxen to step spryly with the plow,<delimiter>Then we learn all too well the troubles of our soul;<delimiter>And all the more so, when the living dolls appear,<delimiter>And usher in many a painful day and night.<delimiter>You know what happens when a bunch of dolls arrives.
“O Adam, the first man of this wanton mankind,<delimiter>Why did you, with your Eve, while hailing the first spring<delimiter>And tasting stealthily of the forbidden fruit,<delimiter>Unto yourself and unto us cause endless woes?<delimiter>Because of your misdeed, the Lord God branded you,<delimiter>Condemned the Earth, and drove you out of Paradise —<delimiter>Caused you to gain your bread by daily toil and sweat.<delimiter>And then you, wretched soul, with grieving Eve your spouse,<delimiter>Wrapped up in hides, ran up and down the hills and dales,<delimiter>Or in the darkness drew away to hide in woods.<delimiter>We too know all too well what a transgression means,<delimiter>When we, because of our misdeeds, must hide from shame.
“To you, our worthy sire, the first of living dolls,<delimiter>Caused never-ending grief and sorrowful dismay.<delimiter>Since then each year arrive great multitudes of dolls,<delimiter>And these dolls, just like yours, are but a source of pain.<delimiter>Of course, your Eve and you had no experience,<delimiter>And knew not how the dolls would grow and multiply,<delimiter>And what a joy and pain they are as they grow up.<delimiter>We wonder what your Eve was thinking at the time<delimiter>Your first-born babe began to cry and search for food —<delimiter>When for the first time she was wiping his behind,<delimiter>Or when she laid to sleep her doll in a dark cave?<delimiter>And, Lord be merciful, what joy you must have known,<delimiter>When in an open field your well-beloved son<delimiter>Rose up in hate and slew his brother with a rock?<delimiter>Yes Adam, by your breach of God’s divine decree,<delimiter>Unto yourself and us you’ve brought unending woe.<delimiter>Like you, we too, upon arriving in this world,<delimiter>Soon find ourselves involved in endless needs and cares,<delimiter>Which from our cradles to our graves abide with us.<delimiter>What can we mortals do? While we are in this world,<delimiter>God willing, we must strive to do our very best.<delimiter>And life is not all pain. There are some joyful days;<delimiter>For after stress and strain we find repose and peace.
“Well, now the winter frosts are far away from us;<delimiter>The darkness of the night now is but brief and pale.<delimiter>Look yon, how the bright sun keeps climbing up each day,<delimiter>Demoists the soil and goads the grass blades to arise.<delimiter>Soon in the meadows we will gather fresh spring blooms,<delimiter>Enjoy their scents divine and hail the joyous spring.<delimiter>Of course the heavy toils will lay upon us too,<delimiter>For we will have to do the pressing feudal tasks.<delimiter>Yes, it will take a lot of painful work and sweat<delimiter>Ere we will reap the crops that are as yet unsown,<delimiter>And a good stretch of time till we will cook new hash!
So meanwhile, while we gaze at God’s benignant hand,<delimiter>Let’s move on and prepare ourselves for heavy work,<delimiter>And let’s not be alarmed on hearing lashing rains,<delimiter>Or when the gales and storms will try to harry us.<delimiter>Let’s hurry, let’s move on, and master ev’ry task!<delimiter>Good agriculture calls for strong and sturdy plows,<delimiter>For harrows sharp and tight and horses brisk and fast.<delimiter>For where an ox plows up the soil in heavy lumps,<delimiter>A horse must harrow down and smooth the rugged ground.”
“Indeed,” sly Slunkius spake, “by God’s eternal will,<delimiter>I have gained on sweet sleep and rested my old bones.<delimiter>So many times without a word about my woes<delimiter>Stretched out and covered up I snored by a warm stove.<delimiter>I wish the winter had remained a longer while,<delimiter>Or that we were sent here just to eat, drink, and sleep!<delimiter>But now, Lord pity us, the summer time draws near<delimiter>And summons us take up unwelcome loads of toil.<delimiter>Ah, wellaway! Sad tears befill my weary eyes;<delimiter>And that old wife of mine —you well know woman’s ways —<delimiter>Wears anger on her face and often sighs and cries.<delimiter>So I, lamenting and forseeing joyless days,<delimiter>I say to her, ‘Dear Ma, for once try not to cry;<delimiter>There is enough of time to do the work undone.<delimiter>We know that an old wheel, which barely turns around,<delimiter>Outlasts the new one, which keeps twirling round and round<delimiter>And falls apart because of turning much too fast.<delimiter>Even a stubborn horse, which hardly moves along,<delimiter>Oft drags a heavy load to a more distant point<delimiter>Than the brisk steed, which struts and jumps himself all out,<delimiter>And oftentimes incurs a mishap needlessly.<delimiter>And take the vender of the homemade axel grease;<delimiter>He, on a squeaky wheel, just drags from town to thorp,<delimiter>And yet he manages to earn a goodly coin.<delimiter>So what of it, if some darn fool works on the run<delimiter>And twists his aching brain, until his heart burns out!’
“My father, Kubas, all his life would never rush,<delimiter>And e’en his father, Stepas, never favored haste.<delimiter>My father many times, while lying drunk in bed<delimiter>Wrapped up in an old coat, would curse and shout at us:<delimiter>‘You children must beware of modern ways and styles!<delimiter>Keep living on the way your parents used to live.<delimiter>Be wise; conserve your strength and never rush at work.<delimiter>Be thrifty; learn to save while you are young and strong,<delimiter>Then in your hoary age you will have good reserves.’<delimiter>And so I took the wise advice of my old man,<delimiter>And will repeat his words as long as I shall live.”
The boors who heard such loose and irrational talk<delimiter>Were much ashamed of him, yet Prickus bravely spoke:<delimiter>“Go on you tumblebug, where tumblebugs prevail!<delimiter>While messing in refuse, you have messed up your home,<delimiter>And caused yourself and all Lithuanians stinging shame.<delimiter>I, when the squire sent me with writ to seize your goods,<delimiter>Myself, you know, have lashed your lazy back so much<delimiter>That your old garments fell to ribbons on your loins.<delimiter>Then too, the watchman almost skinned your hardened hide,<delimiter>And you alimping crept to do the feudal tasks.<delimiter>With drinking revelry, you good-for-nothing wretch,<delimiter>You have devoured your land, your home, your fence and gate!<delimiter>Are you not now ashamed to ruin your children’s lives?
“But you, good neighbors, men of home and family —<delimiter>You, stalwart breadwinners with sweet and gentle wives —<delimiter>We need not be ashamed of irksome farming work:<delimiter>The pitching of manure, the digging in the soil.<delimiter>The First Folk, too, when they lost their solemnity,<delimiter>Only through drudgery could seethe their dinner pot.<delimiter>The Lord did not intend that the remiss should eat;<delimiter>The loafers and truants are never welcome here.<delimiter>Before a hungry mouth may taste a tempting meal,<delimiter>The body must work hard to earn the privilege.
“And therefore, each of us, let’s take our lazy ox<delimiter>And teach him to be fast and willing to obey.<delimiter>His winter idleness and his barn dreams must end;<delimiter>He too must realize that now the summer nears.<delimiter>Merciukas, you indolent fool, why do you laugh?<delimiter>What’s funny that the boors must do the feudal tasks?<delimiter>You know how bad it is when a wild bull rebells,<delimiter>Or when a sullen ox declines to drag the plow.<delimiter>You know how bad it is when an excited boss,<delimiter>Baring his gnashing teeth, lets loose his serpent tongue.
“And you, scapegrace Pukys, be mindful of the fact<delimiter>That Lauras will send you to work for Kasparas.<delimiter>Each year you, heartless rogue, torment the oxen team;<delimiter>Each year you, cruel knave, wear out the faithful beasts.<delimiter>It is a grim sight, when the herder takes afield<delimiter>His herd, and your lean team of oxen barely moves:<delimiter>One, poor thing, scarcely bears his sole remaining horn;<delimiter>The other, who has lost his tail, just creeps along.<delimiter>The watchman recently came here to sequestrate,<delimiter>And questioned angrily whose oxen were so poor.<delimiter>So Paikzentis replied, ‘Pukys owns the lean team.’<delimiter>Now I ask you, Pukys, will ever you reform?<delimiter>Are you bereft of mind that you neglect your beasts?<delimiter>Just think how you would feel if some ferocious ox<delimiter>Would put you to the yoke and make you drag the plow;<delimiter>And then, when you were worn and aching head to foot,<delimiter>Would feed you, like an ox, on but a sheaf of straw,<delimiter>And finally would sell you to a butcher shop?<delimiter>Just think how you would like to till the rugged soil,<delimiter>Hitched to a plow and whipped by an ox behind you.<delimiter>And so, my grumbling friend, be thankful to your God,<delimiter>Because the oxen drag your plow across the field,<delimiter>The horses pull your cart along the winding road.
“Yes; take that red-haired ox and hitch him to a plow,<delimiter>And beat the lazy thing whenever he rebells.<delimiter>He must obey your will, since you supply his feed<delimiter>And suffer him to drink cool water from your brook.<delimiter>And yet you must beware, when goading him to move,<delimiter>That you should not become yourself a raging beast.<delimiter>You know how for a lean and hayless tuft of straw<delimiter>The ox, at your command, digs in to drag your plow —<delimiter>With nostrils, bellows-like, expelling clouds of steam,<delimiter>And tongue protruding, he moves grimly on and on.
“An ox must needs obtain his livelihood by toil;<delimiter>Yet oft, when times are hard and vegetation lean,<delimiter>He has to live on straw, and not too much of that.<delimiter>And oft the selfsame fate befalls us too, my friends,<delimiter>When we, much overtaxed by irksome tasks and toils,<delimiter>Because of lengthy droughts, must gnaw a molded crust,<delimiter>And out of selfsame pools with oxen get our drinks<delimiter>Of water, full of bugs and mud and curdling slime.<delimiter>But worry not my friends and shed no bitter tears;<delimiter>The only reason why we must eat daily meals,<delimiter>God willing, is to keep ourselves in proper health.<delimiter>So let us gladly eat our lean and tasteless mite,<delimiter>Until the autumn days shall bring us fuller meals.
“Look yon, the happy calves skip in the sunlit fields;<delimiter>Young lambs and suckling pigs enjoy the beaming spring.<delimiter>The hens have cackled out so many shiny eggs,<delimiter>And now they gently hum maternal lullabies:<delimiter>Just wait, ere long new broods of chicks will come.<delimiter>Bright goslings even now are rolling out of eggs;<delimiter>The gander proudly hails his growing family<delimiter>And, bowing low, presents his children to the flock.<delimiter>Indeed, all kinds of meats of animals and fowl,<delimiter>For pot and pan each day appear and multiply.
“And now my neighbors, relatives and household heads,<delimiter>Fail not to have your fields plowed up with proper care;<delimiter>Then sow and plant them well with many summer crops.<delimiter>It is not good to live on nothing else but fats;<delimiter>Fresh bread and rolls go well with sausages and meats.<delimiter>And so while we observe the springtime holidays,<delimiter>We must not overlook the balance of the year;<delimiter>For each day, biting off its bit of needed things,<delimiter>Should save a proper share for hungry days to come.”
“Indeed now,” Blekius said, “That which we harvested<delimiter>Last year and stored away for daily household use,<delimiter>Has melted fast away like snow before the spring.<delimiter>Our barns and sheds, once full of precious summer wealth,<delimiter>Are now but empty halls for the fast whirling winds.<delimiter>Our bins and barrels, filled in autumn to the brim<delimiter>With life-sustaining rye, wheat, barley, peas and oats,<delimiter>Now yield but little for our bread and oatmeal pap.<delimiter>The corners where our turnips and potatoes were,<delimiter>The barrels that contained our beets and sauerkraut,<delimiter>Now are all empty, so we now just scratch our heads,<delimiter>And hardly know how to appease our appetites.<delimiter>O you sweet hams, O you rich sausages and pork,<delimiter>We almost cry when we each day remember you.”
“Tut,” Prickus gave him sound Lithuanian advice thus:<delimiter>“You fool, each year you cry that you are short of food.<delimiter>Whose fault is it that when the summer crops are in,<delimiter>You so inhumanly scoop up your food reserves,<delimiter>That by Saint Martin’s you have but a young pig left?<delimiter>You dunce, if you but make your daily meals less rich,<delimiter>Then surely you will have your summer meals less lean.
“So go and do the work that gains your daily bread;<delimiter>Earn your subsistence for the dreary autumn days.<delimiter>Give to the soil its due, if you expect good crops;<delimiter>The field is not obliged to yield great wealth for naught.<delimiter>Tare, thistle, nettle, and many a useless weed<delimiter>Will grow, as you well know, without hard human toil;<delimiter>But useful grain will thrive only when it is sown.<delimiter>Yes, you but gape to eat ham, sausage, veal and pork,<delimiter>And down the good repute of beet and cabbage soups,<delimiter>And that is why each year, having devoured your meats,<delimiter>You drag along half-starved to do your feudal tasks.<delimiter>Go, sow, you gaping fool, sow all that can be sown.<delimiter>Sow barley, lima beans, buckwheat, with faith and zeal.<delimiter>And fail not to sow, too, a goodly lot of oats;<delimiter>For you like the oatmeal and horses like the chaff.<delimiter>Sow, too, a goodly patch of ever-useful peas,<delimiter>For peas do taste so good with freshly cooked mixed mass;<delimiter>Besides, they save so well all other daily foods.<delimiter>And set aside a plot for ever-needed hemp;<delimiter>Skimp not on land or seed; hemp is a handy thing.<delimiter>Is it not good when you make your own rope and net,<delimiter>And save the money for many another use?<delimiter>Sow flax to please your wife, and argue with her not;<delimiter>You know the women’s way; they need a lot of flax<delimiter>When they begin to spin and later on to weave.
“And say not a harsh word about that women’s law.<delimiter>Is it not nice to hear, when the gay women-folk<delimiter>Keep turning spinning wheels, chat, gossip, laugh, and sigh?<delimiter>Is it not sweet to see when Gryta makes the warps,<delimiter>Then weaves the sturdy cloth, then bleaches the new goods,<delimiter>Then makes the linen shirts for all her family,<delimiter>And saves the odds and ends for the much needed clouts?<delimiter>If all the women folk were as industrious,<delimiter>Then no one would go bare or in the shame of rags.<delimiter>For then our feudal boors, dressed up like gentlemen,<delimiter>Would proudly sit among the German egotists,<delimiter>And even the sleek French could not scorn our fine men.
“Yes,” Prickus continued, “that is the honest truth.<delimiter>I, as the chief commune, have traveled far and wide;<delimiter>Have well observed how our unthoughtful women act,<delimiter>When in the wintertime they congregate to spin.<delimiter>I found that some of them are not a bit ashamed<delimiter>When their old spinning wheels will barely turn around.<delimiter>Instead of spinning, they relate so many tales,<delimiter>That their lax hands forget the fibre must be pulled,<delimiter>And their feet neglect to turn the spinning wheel.<delimiter>As thus they chatter, smirk and giggle senselessly,<delimiter>The winter fades away, the smiling spring appears,<delimiter>And finds neither the spinning nor the weaving done.<delimiter>Jeke jumps to make warps, Pime proceeds to weave;<delimiter>But what’s there to weave, when the spinning is not done?<delimiter>And so the family must go without a thread;<delimiter>The men must wear again the same old patched-up pants,<delimiter>The children must play in the village streets threadbare.
“Ye useless women, these words are inscribed for you.<delimiter>But gentle womenfolk, industrious housewives,<delimiter>You need not blush in shame at what has just been said;<delimiter>Just those should blush who are neglectful of their work.<delimiter>For you deserve high praise for spinning speedily,<delimiter>Transforming hards and flax into an even thread.<delimiter>You merit high regard when in the early spring<delimiter>You strike your loom and shift the shuttle back and forth.<delimiter>You reign supreme when your homewoven linen goods,<delimiter>Like gleaming springtime snow, on the green meadows shine.
“And you must not avoid the other homely tasks.<delimiter>Yon, vegetable plots are waiting for your hands.<delimiter>So lay aside the flax and rest the spinning wheel;<delimiter>Ant take the loom apart until the next spring comes.<delimiter>Pick up the rusty spade and dig the fertile soil.<delimiter>Look how the moldwarps raise the molehills in the mead,<delimiter>And urge you to get on with the spring gardening.<delimiter>Indeed, the belly calls for many services.<delimiter>It is not satisfied to be just duly drest,<delimiter>But wishes to enjoy abundant meals each day.<delimiter>Of course the bellies bare will thank you fervently<delimiter>For having covered them with warm and descent clothes —<delimiter>For weaving homespun goods and making pants and shirts;<delimiter>But will thank you much more for your unending care,<delimiter>When covered with new garb, at every meal time,<delimiter>They’ll know the taste of pork and sausage cooked by you.
“And so now plant and sow all kinds of useful seeds.<delimiter>Plant rows of cabbage and sow carrots with full hand;<delimiter>Plant parsnips, rutabagas, turnips, radishes,<delimiter>Cucumbers, lettuce, onions and potatoes too.<delimiter>See that your seedlings do not die of weeds and drought.<delimiter>While doing all these things, enjoy the gay springtime,<delimiter>Before the summer will call you to other tasks.”
<h1>Summer Toils</h1>
Hail everchanging world, with May days come and gone.<delimiter>Hail men, with the advent of sunny summertime.<delimiter>Hail ye, who’ve seen new buds and smelled of their perfume.<delimiter>All hail, and God grant that you see many a spring,<delimiter>And that each spring may find you in the best of health!<delimiter>God bless each one who loves our dear Lithuania old —<delimiter>And who Lithuanian speaks while feudal tasks performs —<delimiter>God grant that he may see many a happy spring,<delimiter>And after each gay spring, a summer full of joy.”<delimiter>So spake ere Whitsuntide old Prickus to the boors,<delimiter>As he was charging them with sundry feudal tasks.
“In sooth,” he said, “a body full of energy<delimiter>Is God’s most precious gift to any mortal man.<delimiter>For he who toils and sweats each day from dawn to dusk,<delimiter>Subsists from day to day on plain and simple meals,<delimiter>And after ev’ry meal gives humble thanks to God,<delimiter>Each night turns to his bed in peace and sleeps at ease.<delimiter>He needs not envy him who wears expensive clothes,<delimiter>But ill at ease each day picks up his spoon in hand.<delimiter>What if some Mykolas possesses a large paunch<delimiter>And proudly bears it like an overblown balloon,<delimiter>Yet like a stinking brute, harrassed by his misdeeds,<delimiter>Has no peace, and like Cain, each day fears Heaven’s wrath?<delimiter>And what if Diksas kneels beside his treasure chest<delimiter>And gloats as through his hands he pours his hoarded gold,<delimiter>Yet dares not use a coin for his most urgent need,<delimiter>But like a madman gulps unseasoned, uncooked food,<delimiter>And wearing filthy rags creeps down the village street?
“We meek Lithuanians, we bast-shod submissive souls,<delimiter>With lords and their valets may never well compare;<delimiter>But neither do we suffer their strange maladies.<delimiter>Lo, in their urban halls they moan and groan so much,<delimiter>That oft they come to us in search of health and rest.<delimiter>There, in the city, one is laid up with his gout;<delimiter>Another’s aches and pains require a doctor’s aid.<delimiter>Why do these countless ills torment the luckless rich?<delimiter>Why does untimely death so often strike them down?<delimiter>It is because they scorn the fruitful work of boors,<delimiter>Lead sinful lives, loaf, sleep too long and eat too much.<delimiter>But here we simple boors, held by the lords as knaves,<delimiter>Fed on unwinnowed bread and pallid buttermilk,<delimiter>Work on the quick each day, as simple folk must do;<delimiter>And if at times we taste a little bit of meat,<delimiter>Or have a piece of ham, or a dish of warm soup,<delimiter>Then all the better we perform our daily work.”
“I say,” spake Lauras leaning on his crooked club,<delimiter>“Thank God that we have passed the spring in all good health,<delimiter>And that the summertime still finds us all alive.<delimiter>Look yon, the beaming sun has ceased to climb the skies<delimiter>And having blazed its course up to the summit clear,<delimiter>Just sits high up in space and smiles upon us all.<delimiter>Observe how heaven’s eye, like a great torch ablaze,<delimiter>Each day dries up the wreaths and garlands of this earth,<delimiter>And turns all the sweet blooms into mere provender.<delimiter>Many a lily white, many a flamming rose,<delimiter>Has lost its maiden look, and has become a hag.<delimiter>Many a bud and bloom’s been plucked by human hands —<delimiter>Adored a while for its great beauty and sweet scent —<delimiter>Then, withered, carelessly upon some trash-heap thrown.
“And even our gay birds have suffered selfsame fate.<delimiter>The cuckoo’s sad refrain, the nightingale’s glad song,<delimiter>The warbling of the lark beneath the sailing clouds —<delimiter>Now we but seldom hear, or never hear at all.<delimiter>Many a small bird, born in a protected nest,<delimiter>Now seeks for daily food without parental care —<delimiter>Repeating its tribe’s sounds, chirps a sad melody.<delimiter>Yea, in such a brief time this world has greatly changed.
“Observing such events at my enfeebled age,<delimiter>At times I sigh with pain and cry in a sad voice:<delimiter>‘Alack a day! How vain and brief is human life!’<delimiter>Indeed, as David wrote, we are but fragile things;<delimiter>Like flowers of the field, we bud and bloom and die.<delimiter>Each mortal at his birth is like a little bud,<delimiter>From which ere long evolves a blossom sweet and fair,<delimiter>Which blows a fleeting while, then casts away its hues,<delimiter>Produces its new seed, and ends its little life.<delimiter>Thus like ephemeral blossoms, we come and go.
“Here we both, rich and poor alike, shed childhood tears,<delimiter>And show but feeble bud of our unfolding age.<delimiter>Then, when the time arrives to offer a full bloom —<delimiter>One, like a fondling vain, brought up in luxury,<delimiter>Another, like a rogue, uncultured and untrained —<delimiter>Waste priceless energy on rash and stupid things.<delimiter>But when the thin mustache begins to shade the lip,<delimiter>And when the time’s at hand for serious, useful work,<delimiter>Then all the childhood pranks and antics steal away.<delimiter>Besides, so often as the children dance and kick,<delimiter>Death mixes in and chokes young lives with his smallpox<delimiter>Or with his typhus germs twirls down the helpless tots.<delimiter>And for the boys and girls he sharpens his old scythe,<delimiter>Without the slightest care for their attractive looks;<delimiter>He blindly strikes them down, and their sweet smiles and curls<delimiter>Lose all the grace and charm, and turn again to naught.<delimiter>Alas! This human life is piteous and brief,<delimiter>Like that of the bright buds that scent the meadows fair.”
As this discourse went on, a frenzied watchman came,<delimiter>And jumping up and down, began to curse so loud,<delimiter>That e’en the solid ground and ev’ry object shook:<delimiter>“I hope the thunder strikes… the devil takes you all…”<delimiter>Ah, man O man, have you become bereft of mind?<delimiter>Why do you swear and curse? Is Satan haunting you?<delimiter>You rogue, why do you shout? What happened to you now?<delimiter>But he swore all the more and acted like a fiend,<delimiter>That e’ven the flocks of birds up in the skies were shocked.<delimiter>And even the sly fox, with bushy tale let down,<delimiter>And the elusive hare, with his long ears cocked up,<delimiter>All out of breath, ran for the nearest shrubs to hide.<delimiter>The toads and frogs, likewise were greatly terrified,<delimiter>And with their young at once dived down into the pond.<delimiter>And e’en the rats with mice and owls, in their dark holes,<delimiter>Because of this man’s hellish rage, grew faint and swooned,<delimiter>And many unnerved sparrows tumbled off the roof.<delimiter>So shocking were the words the angry watchman screamed.
“Woe,” Selmas cried, “There are too many godless men,<delimiter>On whose infernal tongues debauching devils dance.<delimiter>Too oft many a fool, when the glad dawn appears,<delimiter>Not knowing how to pray, and too remiss to read,<delimiter>With curses on his lips crawls out of his foul bed;<delimiter>Then, having cursed and damned his children and his home,<delimiter>Sends out his family to do the daily work.<delimiter>And at the table, too, when it is time to eat,<delimiter>With his satanic words beatifies the food,<delimiter>Then cuts the loaf of bread and gulps the steaming soup.<delimiter>With curses on his lips he starts his daily work,<delimiter>With Satan in his heart he turns to bed at night.
“When a fat lordling swears, that’s nothing new at all;<delimiter>He, having sold himself to servitude of hell,<delimiter>Is too ashamed to pray, treats heaven as a joke,<delimiter>And like an animal, when it is time to die,<delimiter>He dies a swinish death, wallowing in refuse.<delimiter>But when a wreched boor, subsisting on pale whey,<delimiter>Half-dead and half-alive from brutish feudal work,<delimiter>With curses on his lips begins his daily work,<delimiter>That’s something really new and most pitiable!<delimiter>And yet such acts and deeds occur every day.”
As Selmas spoke, the door swung open with a squeek.<delimiter>A summons in his hand, old Prickus walked inside.<delimiter>“Now, men,” the chief commune began to charge the boors,<delimiter>“Our lord bids in a day to start the feudal tasks,<delimiter>And orders us to fetch the muck out of his stalls.<delimiter>So have your horses fed and wagon axles greased;<delimiter>Bring pitchforks of your own, and take along your hooks.<delimiter>You know what tools you need for pitching of manure,<delimiter>And, too, you know how much of it each acre will take.<delimiter>I also, if God grants, will go along with you,<delimiter>And see that all the work that you must do gets done,<delimiter>And that you clean and scrape each stall and ev’ry nook.”<delimiter>Thus having spoke, he turned and swaggered through the door —<delimiter>Alighted on his steed, a stallion four years old,<delimiter>And galloped to announce the hest to other boors.
Now when the set day came, and the pale dawn appeared,<delimiter>The serfs from all around streamed to the manor stalls.<delimiter>Some with their well worn hooks, others with new pitchforks,<delimiter>All in their earnest haste were speeding on the run.<delimiter>Here Albas in a new, just lately finished cart,<delimiter>Merciukas, with a set of brand new thills and wheels,<delimiter>With other men and boys sped down the winding road.<delimiter>Some youngsters in high boots and others in bast shoes,<delimiter>With their long legs wrapped up in snowy linen clouts,<delimiter>Were hurrying on foot along the lanes and paths.<delimiter>And it was strange, for serfs so seldom rush that way;<delimiter>For it is said of boors that they just creep along,<delimiter>And that at times they must be moved by angry words,<delimiter>So that they’d feel the urge to do what’s to be done.
But what’s the use in talking? ’Twas not strange at all.<delimiter>The squire who was in charge of that district’s serfdom<delimiter>Was such a gentle man, that all recalling him<delimiter>Still shed sad tears, although he died a year before.<delimiter>Yes, he deserves full well to be recalled each day,<delimiter>That even the sons’ sons should shed sad tears for him.<delimiter>He was a gentleman! Such men are hard to find.<delimiter>He loved and cherished plain and simple folk, my friends;<delimiter>In turn they revered him and held him in esteem.<delimiter>Many a lordling, when approaching a poor boor,<delimiter>Contemptuously spits on him like on a dog,<delimiter>As if such a man was abject even to see.<delimiter>Our late lamented squire would never scorn a boor,<delimiter>But like a father, he would speak up for the wretch.<delimiter>Thus, we have never heard a foul word from his lips;<delimiter>And if at times the boors would use vile words or swear,<delimiter>Then he paternally told them to hold their tongues.<delimiter>He never would say Tu but always he said Jus;<delimiter>And e’en when scolding he always used plural Jus”.<delimiter>He seldom swore, and then in none but German words;<delimiter>He never failed to praise where praise was due, and then<delimiter>He always used the sweet and pure Lithuanian tongue.
But listen now my brother and I will tell you more.<delimiter>Yea; you and I know well serfdom’s regretful lot,<delimiter>How everyday boors must bend their breaking backs,<delimiter>And drag like burden beasts a load of cares and woes.<delimiter>No mortal can tell all the heartaches of the serfs!<delimiter>You know that each year when the summer reappears<delimiter>Every fool begins to push the boors around:<delimiter>Kasparas, with raised crest upon his shallow head,<delimiter>Like a cock chasing hens, intimidates his men.<delimiter>But his stooge, Diksas, oft outdoes his brutish boss;<delimiter>He drags his rusty sword like an exalted knight,<delimiter>And shouts with loud contempt at the hard working serfs,<delimiter>For he wants to appear much wiser than his lord,<delimiter>And wishes to sit on a higher chair than his.<delimiter>Is that a proper way to treat the manor lord?<delimiter>When such a fool has no regard for his own liege,<delimiter>Is it a wonder that he works the serfs to death?
You know, my friend, ’tis tough to labor in the sun,<delimiter>When streaming beads of sweat roll down the aching back,<delimiter>And a sore stomach growls for an appeasing lunch.<delimiter>Of course it too, each day must be well pacified,<delimiter>But then with what could a boor satisfy his paunch,<delimiter>When he has but a crust of bread and crumbs of cheese?<delimiter>Then having roughly crunched his miserable mite,<delimiter>He’s racked by choking thirst for a reviving gulp,<delimiter>But no one offers him a quaff of homemade brew.<delimiter>So then, of need, he hastens to a stagnant pool,<delimiter>Face downward, breathlessly falls on the muddy bank,<delimiter>And stretched out in full length, laps water full of bugs,<delimiter>As Diksas with his club chastises the poor wretch.
O kindly squire, why did you die a year ago?<delimiter>With your demise, our joys and comforts passed away!<delimiter>O father, ev’ry day the boors, recalling you<delimiter>And sighing constantly, shed tears so bitterly<delimiter>That some of them turn blind because of endless tears,<delimiter>And some of them from grief became bereft of mind,<delimiter>And are not fit to do the feudal servitude.<delimiter>You too, when with their tasks the feudal serfs you charged,<delimiter>Forewarned them not to loaf, but to work hard each day;<delimiter>To heed the royal laws and sundry feudal rules,<delimiter>As all serfs must know well their duties and their tasks;<delimiter>But inhumanely you did not insult the boors.<delimiter>Misfortunes of the poor you viewed with tearful eyes;<delimiter>Whenever Diksas tried to drive the boors too much,<delimiter>You, like a father, oft for the poor victims spoke.<delimiter>Especially when ’twas the time to reap the crops<delimiter>And harvest tasks called us together in the fields,<delimiter>Your care for us awakened all of us in time;<delimiter>Many a night, because of us, you stayed awake,<delimiter>And when you fell asleep, you dreamt about our woes.<delimiter>Thus, striving to help us, you ordered to have made<delimiter>A generous supply of nearbeer and homebrew,<delimiter>So when we weakened or began to moan at work,<delimiter>Your servant hastily for us brought bracing drinks.<delimiter>O well beloved squire, why did you die last year?
“Stop,” cautioned Prickus, “cease your aggravating talk.<delimiter>For such behavior all of you should blush in shame.<delimiter>You will not gain a thing by crying all the while,<delimiter>But turn to be purblind and feeble-minded wrecks,<delimiter>Unfit to do hard work and raise your families.<delimiter>Of course it is the truth that our lamented squire,<delimiter>While in the prime of life, has met a tragic death,<delimiter>And caused us much of grief and many bitter tears.<delimiter>I too, because of his demise, passed sleepless nights,<delimiter>And drenched my pillow with an endless stream of tears.<delimiter>It got so bad that I would jump at night and scream,<delimiter>When horned hags would draw around my haunted bed<delimiter>And slowly creep at me to snatch away my soul.<delimiter>Then, worn and terrified, I bought myself a gun,<delimiter>Filled it with deadly lead, and kept it in my bed.<delimiter>Since then no hag or spook has ever troubled me,<delimiter>And since then I have ceased to jump and scream at night.
“Now, let us fetch the stuff that irks the ugly frogs,<delimiter>Confounds the stealthy mice and scares the hooting owls;<delimiter>This precious substance lies in all stalls and hog pens,<delimiter>And on the beams, whereon the cackling chickens drowse.<delimiter>So let’s clean out all stables and all sheds and sties,<delimiter>And since there often is some of this priceless stuff<delimiter>On walls and parapets, we have to scrape them too.<delimiter>Why do you laugh, you fool? This is not vulgar talk!
You know a boor, if he expects to have good crops,<delimiter>Must fertilize the soil with proper excrement.<delimiter>Your own pot, when you cook your daily stew or broth,<delimiter>Calls not for salt alone, but for a soup bone, too.<delimiter>Why don’t you sup your soup without all condiments?<delimiter>And yet you chide the boors for spreading good manure<delimiter>That rich nutrition gives to the exhausted soil.<delimiter>So you, too, come along and take your fork in hand,<delimiter>And start to dig with us this aromatic wealth.<delimiter>For from the small acorns the giant oaks grow up,<delimiter>And from the low manure uncounted blessings come.
“A certain wretched lord keeps smirking at the boors,<delimiter>And as he smirks, the dupe, derides their fetid work —<delimiter>As if without the boors he could parade around,<delimiter>And without strong manure could eat his bread and cake.<delimiter>What would become of lords if there were no meek serfs,<delimiter>And if the serfs did not help them out with manure?<delimiter>So never mind, men, dig and fetch the precious muck,<delimiter>Though its unpleasant smell may make you sneeze and choke,<delimiter>And though you have to wade in slimy feculence.<delimiter>The tender nostrils of the idle noblemen<delimiter>Disdain your messy work, and your mephitic garb;<delimiter>But mark how soon those fops would bend low before you,<delimiter>If they had to fill up their stomachs, as we do,<delimiter>With meatless soups and groats and with unwinnowed bread,<delimiter>And then along with you would do the feudal tasks.”
But listen Prickus! Will you tell that to the lords?<delimiter>You know that ev’ry time a feudal lord goes by,<delimiter>The boor must bare his head and bow down to the ground<delimiter>And you’re the very first to bow before the rich.<delimiter>Of lords you spoke the truth. But are you not afraid<delimiter>That they might lash your flanks, or hang you by the neck?<delimiter>Of course, in ev’ry walk of life you’ll find a fool:<delimiter>He peeps not only from under an old drab frock —<delimiter>From under a silk cloak he often snickers, too.<delimiter>So do not wonder if you hear a pompous gawk<delimiter>Ablabbing stupid words. He would talk sensibly,<delimiter>If only he’d been taught to do the work we do.
Well, that will be enough to jest about the dung.<delimiter>About the meads and fields we’ll have to prattle, too.<delimiter>So hurry, boys, the day is drawing to a close;<delimiter>Tomorrow we must put a new edge on the scythes.<delimiter>Hark, yon, the whippoorwill calls us to mow the hay<delimiter>And to store up high stacks for the ensuing year.<delimiter>And ’tis a timely call; Saint John’s great holiday,<delimiter>After tomorrow, as you know, we will observe,<delimiter>And then ere long the harvest will be in full swing.<delimiter>“Ah,” spoke up Krizas, “now we’ll have to move quite fast,<delimiter>If we are to complete our many boorish tasks.<delimiter>O Lord, how can a poor boor end his woes and cares,<delimiter>When his own family heeds not his words and will?<delimiter>Mark me, my friend, I am of old and hoary age;<delimiter>And in my day I’ve roamed far corners of this land,<delimiter>So I can tell you strange events and monstrous things.<delimiter>My father, Krizas, died when I was a small boy,<delimiter>And my poor mother had oft times to beg for alms.<delimiter>Because of poverty, it fell to wretched me<delimiter>To herd the nasty pigs of old man Bleberis<delimiter>Then having herded his mixed herd for a good while,<delimiter>And having troubled much with dirty, stubborn pigs,<delimiter>Soon I felt a desire to harrow and to plow.<delimiter>For I e’en as a silly lad had lots of brains,<delimiter>And as a youngster got ahead of older men.<delimiter>As soon as I had seen utensils made of wood,<delimiter>Just think of it, I too could make such things as well;<delimiter>So one old bachelor woodcarver envied me,<delimiter>And even ran from me ashamed to show his face.
“Of course, it is not nice for a gray-headed man,<delimiter>To be shamed by the work of a young nincompoop,<delimiter>When he intends to get more dollars for his pay,<delimiter>And e’en is not ashamed to pry out more seed grain.<delimiter>O what became of the bewhiskered Prussian days,<delimiter>When hired help was so cheep and so obedient?
“When I was but a lad, employed by Bleberis,<delimiter>I used to be surprised, when farmers of good means,<delimiter>Each year while hiring help would add a dollar more —<delimiter>And how the help would brag that the kindhearted boss<delimiter>Had thrown in as a tip a sixpense for a drink;<delimiter>And if a pair of pants was promised as a gift,<delimiter>The joyful help would praise the farmer evermore.<delimiter>But since the employees have learned the latest ways,<delimiter>And since they mix and mill with Germans more and more,<delimiter>Politeness and good grace are waning fast away;<delimiter>Men now refuse to wear white linens and bast shoes,<delimiter>And girls care not to don their multicolored skirts.<delimiter>The rustic boys now wear high boots and shiny shoes,<delimiter>And too, the farmerettes, like fashionable dames,<delimiter>Dress up in stylish clothes and strut unblushingly.<delimiter>And thus our people harm their ancient good repute.
“And now some of our men are e’en ashamed to eat<delimiter>Their meals prepared in good olden Lithuanian style.<delimiter>Our crafty ancestors, cooking thin oatmeal pap<delimiter>And serving it to their beloved families,<delimiter>Created pride and joy in their old happy homes.<delimiter>And if at times they served some condimented hash,<delimiter>Or now and then mixed in small bits of chitterlings,<delimiter>The hired help then acclaimed aloud their kindly boss.<delimiter>But these days all of them, agaping for the meat<delimiter>And snatching it like dogs, torment the luckless boor.
“Just hear my kindly brother what befell poor me:<delimiter>For almost fifty years I have maintained this house,<delimiter>And handled all details of food and cookery;<delimiter>I’ve pleased the noble lords and the hardworking boors;<delimiter>But I could never please the everhungry help.<delimiter>My thrift increases as I seethe the dinner pot,<delimiter>But when I dish the meats, I pass it in large chunks.<delimiter>And then, no wonder, when the tribute must be paid,<delimiter>I cannot meet it; so my chief denounces me<delimiter>And in a beastly rage, he boxes my poor ears.<delimiter>And I’m not better off when the impost is due.
“But how can poor I pay what’s needed to the lords,<delimiter>When the rapacious help devours all meats and foods?<delimiter>Alas! Ere long to begging I will be reduced.<delimiter>So many herds of cows, sheep, oxen, calves and pigs<delimiter>I had to slay and kill within these recent months,<delimiter>That where to hang the hides and skins I hardly know.<delimiter>Just yesterday I killed a bull to feed the help,<delimiter>And I’m ashamed to say, the meat now is all gone,<delimiter>And of that massive beast but bones and horns remain.<delimiter>So now the gluttons vomit and demand for veal,<delimiter>Keep their loud howling up and shamelessly insist<delimiter>That I should kill for them the lone remaining calf.
“Then with the wages, too, there is much fuss each year.<delimiter>A brat who hardly knows how to put on his pants,<delimiter>Who shamefully — I hope you will not think me rude —<delimiter>Like a demented slouch, while sleeping wets his bed,<delimiter>And knows not even how to herd a few tame pigs;<delimiter>And yet the lousy knave, e’en if you feign to hire him,<delimiter>Has nerve to pry from you more dollars for his pay.<delimiter>Among the grown farm hands at times there is a rogue,<delimiter>Who knows not how to trail a harrow or a plow,<delimiter>Is scared to catch a bullock by his blunted horns —<delimiter>And when a restless bull begins to paw and moo,<delimiter>The dolt gets so upset, that even his knees shake —<delimiter>Yet such a brainless fool so oft sticks out his chest,<delimiter>Boasts of his usefulness and of his might and skill,<delimiter>And scowls when he is not rewarded with high pay.<delimiter>Just try and offer him — with your old cap removed<delimiter>And bending your head low — ten dollars pay a year,<delimiter>And he will shout and ask from you a larger share<delimiter>In rye and other crops as added recompense.
“When such hands start to work, you cannot help but fret.<delimiter>The scoundrels, over-fed on fresh and seasoned meats,<delimiter>And over-filled with brew and other bracing drinks,<delimiter>Oft times are seen — one here, another there — streched out,<delimiter>Face downward by a fence or pathway, fast asleep.<delimiter>At times the rogues think of a secret hiding place,<delimiter>Then you may search and search and never find their lair.<delimiter>You may blow horns or shout, or call them by their names,<delimiter>‘Hey, Kubas, Hans, Enskys! Where are you loafing now?<delimiter>The eve is nigh and you have not begun to work.<delimiter>Good men like ants rush on to end unfinished tasks;<delimiter>They work in earnest and in haste so all is done.<delimiter>But you, you shirkers, all the day in hiding sleep.<delimiter>What will become of you if you shall not reform?<delimiter>Of course you would expect that they, on such a-call,<delimiter>Would, as behoves them, jump and start right in to work;<delimiter>But those vile parasites just grin and laugh at you,<delimiter>And if you scold them then they curse and threaten you.<delimiter>And even that’s not all — they even beat you up.<delimiter>Of course you well recall how Slunkius at the fair,<delimiter>A year ago, when he had drank a quart of wine,<delimiter>Enraged, assaulted me and almost cleaved my head;<delimiter>Then next, he seized upon a heavy birchen rod,<delimiter>And aided by his thugs, he cut my back so deep,<delimiter>That for many a week I was confined to bed.<delimiter>The very thought of it makes my gray hair stand up!”
As Krizas so complained, large crowds of men appeared,<delimiter>Ashouting, “Jump, mow, rake, make hay and store away!”<delimiter>The fields, like anthills, now began to swarm and buzz;<delimiter>The farmers and the help swung scythes and shook their feet.<delimiter>Indeed, it seemed as if an army set for war,<delimiter>With shining metal blades, attacked the verdant meads.<delimiter>At once grim death began to strike each leaf and bloom;<delimiter>The mortal blows fell on every lea and dale.<delimiter>Bright buds and blossoms sweet, so young, so gay, so fair,<delimiter>Were falling all around before the tempered steel.<delimiter>New buds, like blooming youth — lighthearted, playful brave —<delimiter>Old blooms, like hoary age — dejected, frail, infirm —<delimiter>Were being mowed by death on each and ev’ry side.<delimiter>Ere long each mead and dale became completely bare —<delimiter>Except Plauciunas’ tract, which still remained intact.
Plauciunas, that old sot, drank at the harvest feast<delimiter>Of Kasparas last year too much mead, too much wine;<delimiter>So by the time he left the feast he was so drunk,<delimiter>That he lost his way and lost, too, his hone and scythe,<delimiter>And e’en found not his house until the next mid-morn.<delimiter>He fell into his bed and snored there all day long;<delimiter>He never said a word about his hone and scythe<delimiter>Until the whippoorwill announced the harvest time.<delimiter>At last Plauciunas missed his long-lost property,<delimiter>And now began to search for them in ev’ry place.<delimiter>When he failed to find them, he seized a birchen rod,<delimiter>And the stinkard almost lashed to death his wife and babes.
Enraged beyond all bounds, he bridled his last nag,<delimiter>And rode, in harvest time, straight to Karaliaucius.<delimiter>Intending there to buy a new hone and new scythe.<delimiter>But in the city, when he saw so much of wealth,<delimiter>He just strolled aimlessly and mumbled foolishly,<delimiter>And thus forgot to buy a new hone and new scythe.<delimiter>He drank away by Mikas his exhausted nag,<delimiter>And in a fortnight reached his home on foot, quite broke;<delimiter>Then in his teamless field — it is a shame to say —<delimiter>Morose, alone, the dry rye with a sickle chopped,<delimiter>When all his neighbors had already stored their crops,<delimiter>And some of them had baked and tasted new wheat cakes.
And as I stood and mused, a serf of Kasparas<delimiter>Was chasing pigs out of Plauciunas’ pallid rye.<delimiter>“Whose porkers are these?” I questioned the breathless serf.<delimiter>He said, “Keep still! The pigs belong to Kasparas,<delimiter>The rye — to Plauciunas, who yon pounds his sickle.”<delimiter>You know how he each year is late to do his work,<delimiter>Like a foul tumblebug amessing in the dung.<delimiter>Now when a farmer is so tardy with his work,<delimiter>And like a louse filled up with blood but creeps along,<delimiter>What will a farm hand do when he is told to speed?
Said Paikzentis, the hand of learned Bleberis,<delimiter>“My friend, think not that just our elegant young men<delimiter>At banquets with young girls skip foolishly around<delimiter>And drink to such excess, that e’en the rustics blush;<delimiter>Of late the rugged boors engage in these things too.<delimiter>Some folks think all is grace that the rich men admire,<delimiter>And that all things are wise that they ablabbing say.<delimiter>Many vain lordlings strut around with chests thrust out,<delimiter>Gorge costly caviar and glup imported frogs,<delimiter>And then, much overfed and overfilled with wine,<delimiter>At cards in turn relieve each other of their cash.<delimiter>The boors now having learned from them the gambling tricks<delimiter>But grin when Krizas swindles Krizas in the game.”
“Do not complain so much,” I said to Paikzentis,<delimiter>As inwardly I praised his words, but looked askance.<delimiter>They say that the townsfolk regard the boors as knaves,<delimiter>And scorn their rustic ways and their provincial homes<delimiter>As nasty to look at and foul to talk about.<delimiter>But those who so opine know not our peasantry.<delimiter>Believe you me, at times a bast-shod simpleton<delimiter>With his unwitting brain outwits a nobleman,<delimiter>But the poor thing dares not to speak up when he should.
And as I sat and mused, a distant noise arose.<delimiter>I thought a herd of oxen on the rampage blared;<delimiter>’Twas the Plauciunas’ boys bringing the rye tuft home.<delimiter>You know how boisterously our Lithuanians act,<delimiter>When after Saint Jacob’s rye harvesting is done;<delimiter>They dance and shout, “We bring the Harvest Sheaf!”<delimiter>Thus the Plauciunas’ boys, to make their father glad,<delimiter>Fetched home a sheaf of rye and hollered lustily.<delimiter>But now the pallid ears were grainless and dried up —<delimiter>Just bent and twisted straw, and fit for naught but dross.<delimiter>But then these harvesters began to play rude games.<delimiter>Mercius and Lauras dragged the girls into a pond,<delimiter>And Pakuliene with Lauriene, tit for tat,<delimiter>With milking buckets watered raging men and boys.<delimiter>And as they played crude games and wallowed piggishly,<delimiter>Loud quarrels and mad shouts arose amidst the crowd.<delimiter>Laurynas, soaking wet, seized the bedampened sheaf;<delimiter>Then Pakuliene grabbed a spade to strike him with.<delimiter>But as the turmoil rose, Plauciunas came outside,<delimiter>Passed to the harvesters large chunks of salted pork,<delimiter>And therewith their uproar and feud he pacified.<delimiter>But as he wined and dined the tardy harvesters<delimiter>And roundly entertained his neighbors and his friends,<delimiter>He, too, kept drinking on and on so pigishly,<delimiter>And was the very first to fall beneath the bench.
“Alas,” good Selmas cried, “Such be the present times,<delimiter>Since many Swiss and French have settled in our land.<delimiter>Now some Lithuanians, too, behave and act like pigs.<delimiter>They vilefy the Swiss in their own native tongue,<delimiter>While they themselves behave no better than the Swiss.<delimiter>In olden days, when the Lithuanians were pagans,<delimiter>From stakes and logs of wood they fashioned their idols,<delimiter>Placed them in giant oak trees and worshiped their strange gods,<delimiter>For then they did not know the true God, as we do.<delimiter>And they did many strange and superstitious things.<delimiter>But now we, too, although we are Christian Prussians,<delimiter>Yea, we Lithuanians, we surfeit ourselves too much,<delimiter>And cause the arrogant Germans to sneer at us.”
As Selmas so complained, the overseer yelled out:<delimiter>“Why do you dawdle, boys? The downpour’s coming on,<delimiter>And columns of the sun are looming o’er the clouds.<delimiter>Plauciunas worries you? Leave him alone to rot!<delimiter>Let’s gather while we may the products of the soil.<delimiter>The fields have ripened now; the summer soon will end.<delimiter>The last remaining crops we must get in at once.<delimiter>Yon lima beans are pale; the peas are wrinkled up;<delimiter>From the beweathered pods the grain is falling out.<delimiter>Is not it a grave sin to spurn God’s blessed gifts,<delimiter>For which each one of you have worked so fervently?<delimiter>Say, is not it a sin to waste the precious grain?<delimiter>How will we get along without the beans and peas,<delimiter>When in the winter time we’ll want to cook hot soup?<delimiter>The birds have gobbled up our spring crops on the straw,<delimiter>And what is left, the pigs are claiming as their share.<delimiter>Thus, having loafed away our hash and oatmeal pap,<delimiter>Of barley groats we’ll hardly have enough to taste.<delimiter>Have I not oft told you to reap the crops in time?<delimiter>But you like deaf have failed to heed my sound advice,<delimiter>So now our oatmeal pap and our mixed mass is gone.<delimiter>Alas! How shall we do the summer feudal tasks,<delimiter>And how will we cut chaff when the cold winter comes?<delimiter>With enmpty mouths we will perform our daily work,<delimiter>And to our cattle, starved because of lack of feed,<delimiter>All we will have to offer will be hayless straw.
“And you good women folk, have you too gone astray?<delimiter>Why don’t you run along and gather your dried flax?<delimiter>Aren’t you ashamed when the industrious German wives,<delimiter>Having threshed all their flax and laid it in the meads,<delimiter>So sneeringly deride your wanton laziness?<delimiter>O ye Lithuanian wives, do you not feel ashamed —<delimiter>Do you not blush or flush — when zealous German wives,<delimiter>With their superior work abash you constantly?<delimiter>Yea; when the time has come to spin, what will you spin,<delimiter>When your flax still remains bescattered in the fields?<delimiter>O, what became of those bewhiskered times of old,<delimiter>When our sweet women did not dress in German clothes,<delimiter>And e’en could not pronounce the awkward German words!<delimiter>But now ’tis not enough that they don German styles:<delimiter>What’s worse, they now attempt to speak in lisping French<delimiter>And, babbling all the while, they fail to do their work.
“Oh men, why don’t you stop your well-beloved wives<delimiter>And daughters young and sweet from leading useless lives?<delimiter>Do you want to walk nude before the German folk<delimiter>And be ashamed at feasts and public gatherings?<delimiter>You miserable fools, do you not realize<delimiter>What stinging shame you’ll bring upon yourselves and us,<delimiter>When in patched pants you’ll go to do the feudal tasks,<delimiter>And for a holy mess you’ll gather in old rags?<delimiter>Have pity and cause not such a degrading shame;<delimiter>Drive out at once your wives to harvest the ripe flax.<delimiter>For some of it still stands unsnouted by the pigs,<delimiter>And might as yet suffice for sundry rags and clouts,<delimiter>But will be not enough for petticoats and pants.<delimiter>And mushrooms, too! Good Lord, there’ll be none e’en to taste.<delimiter>They say the German wives pick mushrooms by the peck,<delimiter>And dry them in their stoves for home and marketing.<delimiter>Within the woods and groves they have picked such a lot<delimiter>Of bolets, chanterells, russulas, and verdetts,<delimiter>And other mushrooms, that each day now they convey<delimiter>To Karaliaucius and dispose of them for cash,<delimiter>Wherewith they buy all kinds of useful wears and goods;<delimiter>Left-over mushrooms they conserve for household needs.<delimiter>For us now there is none, save some nasty toadstools.<delimiter>Alack, how shall we cook the stew and barley groats,<delimiter>With not one mushroom saved for tasteful flavoring?<delimiter>You know a mushroom picked and dried in summer time,<delimiter>Improves so much our soups in frigid winter days.
“The same thing happened with the tasty hazel nuts.<delimiter>The active German wives have gathered barrels full,<delimiter>And some of them filled up large sacks for marketing.<delimiter>But our lax women have not picked a single nut —<delimiter>Not e’en the tiny one, a little baby nut —<delimiter>To crack and taste in the oncoming winter days.<delimiter>Of course, most men care not for such tidbits as nuts;<delimiter>To them tobacco is — although it fouls the house —<delimiter>So much to be preferred to any kind of nuts.<delimiter>Our toothless grannies, too, have no sweet tooth for them;<delimiter>To offer nuts to them is a crude mockery.<delimiter>As some one aptly said, ‘An old crone’s rattling teeth<delimiter>Are much too weak to crack a honey-flavored nut.’
“But e’en a measly nut should not be meanly scorned,<delimiter>For many girls and boys such goodies oftentimes<delimiter>Chew with delight and praise with many happy words.<delimiter>In winter, when Katre is spinning drowsily,<delimiter>A cracking of a nut awakens her at once;<delimiter>Or when Jeke keeps on ababbling with Pime,<delimiter>A few sweet hazel nuts stuck in their flapping mouths<delimiter>At once would stop their loud and tireless chattering.<delimiter>But what will happen now, when older women folk<delimiter>And youthful maids sit down to spin by the cold stove<delimiter>And there is not a nut to still their talking tongues?<delimiter>Indeed, the spinning wheels of ladies sweet and fair,<delimiter>Aspinning flax and tow, will cease to turn around.<delimiter>And with the winter gone we all will walk thread-bare.”
“There now,” spoke up Jeke, defending women folk,<delimiter>“Say, ladies, shall we now let men shame us like that?<delimiter>What noise! Whence does it come? Men, you belittle us.<delimiter>Do you wish to squeeze out our very breath and soul?<delimiter>Prate not about the flax, blab not about the tow.<delimiter>Attend to your own work and wintertime supplies!<delimiter>Ere long the Michaelmas great holiday will come<delimiter>And usher in the rains and drizzles of the fall;<delimiter>And yet the summer crops still languish in the fields;<delimiter>The weather beaten hemp still sways against the wind.”
As this debate went on, the watchman showed up, too,<delimiter>With Slapjurgis, and Pakuluns, the overseer.<delimiter>The boors now at the sight of these stern-visaged men<delimiter>Became so much afraid, that all at once were still.<delimiter>The haughty watchman grabbed a goodly birchen rod,<delimiter>Then shouting angrily, he threw at them these words:<delimiter>“Ye, feudal serfs, mark well what we will tell you now —<delimiter>Old women and young girls, keep your wide mouths shut tight! —<delimiter>We, your superiors, at this opportune time,<delimiter>Now that the summer days and summer duties end,<delimiter>We came here to give you our fatherly advice.<delimiter>Almighty God, who has created this wide world<delimiter>And given us good hearts and understanding minds —<delimiter>He, our good Father and our Benefactor kind,<delimiter>Who always cares for us — once more has blest us well;<delimiter>He’s given us much bread and fodder for our kine.<delimiter>You all recall how lean was our supply of food,<delimiter>When in the spring the sun began to climb the skies,<delimiter>And in our boorish way we went to work the fields.<delimiter>Our sausages and pork, as well as ham and cheese,<delimiter>Were gone. We had to get along on meatless meals;<delimiter>In vain we wished and searched for bits of condiments.<delimiter>And e’en the oatmeal pap, our daily boorish food,<delimiter>From ev’ry table had completely disappeared.<delimiter>But as the winter fled, the smiling springtime came,<delimiter>Again the Lord gave us the sunlit summer days.<delimiter>Now once again fresh food and fruit was plentiful,<delimiter>And we again had things to eat of many kinds.<delimiter>Still later all our nooks and corners were filled up,<delimiter>With all kinds of good things, and we ate healthful meals.<delimiter>And now that summer is again about to end,<delimiter>We all, who have lived through so many hungry days,<delimiter>Bang our old pots and pans, preparing wholesome meals,<delimiter>To still our appetites and to revive our souls.
“But man O man, fail not to glorify His name,<delimiter>Because He with His hosts assisted you each day<delimiter>To work and cultivate your wealth-producing fields.<delimiter>For now all that the orchards promised in the spring,<delimiter>And, too, all that the fields raised through the summer days,<delimiter>That precious wealth you have brought in and stored away,<delimiter>And therewith the good Lord will keep you till the spring.<delimiter>Should not you lift your eyes toward the firmament<delimiter>Each morning, noon and night, and give your solemn thanks<delimiter>To Him who once again gave you such ample wealth?<delimiter>Yes neighbors, this above all else you have to do.<delimiter>Then you must faithfully obey your feudal lords,<delimiter>And render to the school and church their proper share —<delimiter>Then pay to me what’s due, when riding on horse back<delimiter>To tax and to collect, I shall call upon you.<delimiter>You know it is tough when the angry watchmen come<delimiter>And scold the stupid boors with rash and ugly words.<delimiter>Well then beware, and stuff your pocketbooks in time,<delimiter>So that each one of you, when I call for the tax,<delimiter>Is able to pay it in fistfuls of cold cash.
“Your master and my liege, our most benignant squire —<delimiter>God bless his tender heart — bade me to greet you thus,<delimiter>And to beseech each one of you to be prepared,<delimiter>And save me seizures and the beating of your hides;<delimiter>Because his clement heart takes pity on poor boors.<delimiter>Well, I have told you all that I was told to tell.<delimiter>To all of you, when you again will celebrate<delimiter>The autumn’s fruitfulness, I wish you joyful times.<delimiter>But pray, invite me too, and all my family,<delimiter>When you will entertain your relatives and friends.<delimiter>That’s that. Now as we spend the summer’s last sweet days,<delimiter>Ere fall sets in, let’s not forget what’s yet not done.”
<h1>Autumn Wealth</h1>
Look yon, the sun again is rolling down the sky:<delimiter>Each day shows less and less of its majestic rays,<delimiter>Stretches out more and more the shadows of all things,<delimiter>And in a greater haste descends beyond the hills.<delimiter>The winds, with wings bespread, show nasty arrogance,<delimiter>And hum as they dispel the last of summer’s warmth.<delimiter>The weather, too, is now inclement, harsh and cold;<delimiter>It drives the young and strong to their warm sheepskin coats,<delimiter>Compels the old and weak to hug the blazing stove,<delimiter>Goads one and all to stay within the windtight home,<delimiter>And there to cook and eat lukewarm or steaming soups.
The sodden ground along the road sheds streams of tears,<delimiter>As rolling wheels renew the ruts in its slashed back.<delimiter>Where two old dobbins once could drag a heavy load,<delimiter>Now even four of them can scarcely do the task.<delimiter>The cracking wheels around the axle barely turn,<delimiter>Yet splash all round about the carts the squashy mud.<delimiter>Few strips of soil remain above the flooded land,<delimiter>As the relentless rains pour on the peasants’ backs.<delimiter>Old bast shoes and worn boots imbibe the squashy mud<delimiter>And kneed the ugly mire as a fermenting dough.
O what became of those delightful springtime days,<delimiter>When we flung all our doors and windows open wide,<delimiter>And felt the warming rays of the ascending sun?<delimiter>Just as a dream, so real and lovely in our sleep,<delimiter>Upon our wakening abides with us no more,<delimiter>So the gay summer days stay briefly and then fade.<delimiter>And now the sluicy mud, prest down by a bast shoe,<delimiter>Bubbles like oatmeal pap within a boiling pot.<delimiter>All things that danced and sang beneath the glowing sun —<delimiter>All things that roamed the woods and scurried in the fields,<delimiter>All things that soared and dived beneath the silv’ry clouds,<delimiter>And having sung their joy, then fed on grain and bugs —<delimiter>All, all are gone, alas! and are with us no more.<delimiter>Only the melancholy fields remain with us,<delimiter>But all their beauty now smells like a rotting grave.
Death strikes the pliant bush and the majestic grove;<delimiter>Irate winds crush the charm of buds and blossoms fair,<delimiter>And break the bough on which a family was born,<delimiter>And on which the new brood chirped out their first complaints —<delimiter>‘Neath which bough they began to hop about and laugh —<delimiter>And learned to find a worm without their mother’s aid.<delimiter>Now each bough and each twig is thoroughly swept bare;<delimiter>Like withered rods, they creak and sigh before the wind.<delimiter>There, where the sly bear stole the honey from the bees,<delimiter>And his mate muttered as she suckled her frail cubs —<delimiter>There, where the elks were chased by the repacious wolves,<delimiter>And where the wolf cubs learned to growl and hunt for game;<delimiter>There, where the black hawk fed his young on chicken meat,<delimiter>And where the raven brought a gosling to his nest,<delimiter>Lo, there, all summer joy and merriment is gone!<delimiter>The crows alone sing praise to the ungainly fall.<delimiter>The rest of the gay flocks are never seen or heard;<delimiter>They hide in cold retreats and dream uncheerful dreams.
Alas, the gardens too, with all their loveliness —<delimiter>Fresh buds and blossoms sweet, the beauty of the spring,<delimiter>And its divine perfumes — all, all has passed away!<delimiter>The wealth that the green meads displayed in merry May,<delimiter>The gifts that the lush fields gave forth in joyous June,<delimiter>We now have gathered and stored up beneath the roof;<delimiter>These riches now we cook and eat each blessed day.<delimiter>You there, you gaggling geese, and you too, quacking ducks,<delimiter>Run — run and swim before the streaming rivers freeze.<delimiter>You roosters and you hens, leave your dirt-pile a while;<delimiter>Run once again and play before the snowdrifts come;<delimiter>And think not that we keep and feed you in our barns<delimiter>Because your clucks are sweet or your cackles are grand.<delimiter>Ah no! It is because we like your tender meat.
’Tis strange to see how sharp the women grind their knives<delimiter>And frightening to hear how loud they bang their pots.<delimiter>Pime and Gryta search for the fire-giving flint,<delimiter>And Salomeja scalds her linen shirts and clouts;<delimiter>Katryne and Berge scour rusty pots and pans,<delimiter>And at the same time blow with their thick, pursed-up lips<delimiter>Into the stove to start the fire around the pot.<delimiter>Maguze and Jeke work on the firewood pile;<delimiter>Enskys is fetching home an armful of dry twigs.<delimiter>But lusk Docys is dozing by the flaming stove<delimiter>And smacking his foul lips, awaiting for the meal,<delimiter>Because Aste has in the oven a large fowl,<delimiter>Is cooking barley groats, and baking bread and cake.
And while Docys worked up his healthy appetite,<delimiter>A fat matchmaker came and asked all to attend<delimiter>Good Krizas’ daughter’s gay and lavish wedding ball.<delimiter>All members of the house politely bent their heads<delimiter>Before the groomsman proud, and told him that they would<delimiter>Go with sincere delight to the gay nuptial feast.<delimiter>And surely, after that, when the eighth day appeared,<delimiter>The neighborhood began to dress for the event.<delimiter>Mercius and Stepas having bought new leather boots,<delimiter>Jonas and Lauras having made brand new bast shoes,<delimiter>Dressed for the wedding ball and bridled their old nags.<delimiter>Especially Enskys, with care washed his gray horse<delimiter>And put a saddle with new stirrups shining bright;<delimiter>Then having washed and groomed his horse full well, he strapped<delimiter>His own strong, manly loins with a new leather belt,<delimiter>And pulled waxed wedding boots onto his lanky legs.<delimiter>Like the men, women, too, were on the way by scores;<delimiter>They also had been asked to grace the wedding ball,<delimiter>And each of them was drest in rainbow-colored clothes.<delimiter>But no Germanic styles they wore, as some oft do.<delimiter>No; each one donned the garb of her own fashioning.<delimiter>Of course you know how our Lithuanian women dress<delimiter>For weddings, visiting ,and various gatherings.<delimiter>The matrons all wear hoods, and kerchiefs, and headcloths,<delimiter>And maidens all adorn their hair with wreaths of rues.<delimiter>A married woman does not wear a wreath of rues,<delimiter>A maiden does not don a wedded woman’s hood.
Ere long a goodly crowd, attired in choisest clothes,<delimiter>Conversing brazenly, filled Krizas’ modest home.<delimiter>Good Krizas smiled and bowed as he met ev’ry guest.<delimiter>Then, having welcomed them to his delightful house,<delimiter>Brought in a goodly jug of whiskey of rare kind,<delimiter>And urged each guest to drink his fill — and drink again.<delimiter>The mother of the bride passed cakes and sweets around,<delimiter>And soon the guests became hilariously gay;<delimiter>They e’en began to play their silly games and tricks —<delimiter>And one of them while eating even mentioned dung.
As the guests gorged themselves with food and potent drinks,<delimiter>Loud laughter, tactless tales, and squeaky songs arose,<delimiter>And e’en the nags outside began to jump and neigh.<delimiter>The fat matchmaker now was riding in great haste,<delimiter>Ashouting in harsh tones and lashing his poor horse.<delimiter>You rascal, why do you mistreat your animal?<delimiter>Has not he long endured the feudal cruelties?<delimiter>Why do you mutilate poor dobbin’s flanks with spurs?<delimiter>Ride slowly, you gaper, and do not harm your horse!<delimiter>Tomorrow you will have to truck the manor wood,<delimiter>And the next day you might decide to take a ride.<delimiter>As he lashed his old horse and mumbled boorishly,<delimiter>Into the crowded yard rode then the newly-weds,<delimiter>Who by the bishop’s hand at the communion rail<delimiter>Had been divinely blest and joined forevermore.
The relatives and friends and neighbors drew around<delimiter>The beaming pair, wished them a happy married life,<delimiter>And ushered them inside for the gay bridal feast.<delimiter>Both Krizas and his wife, folks well advanced in age,<delimiter>Were happy that they lived to see their daughter wed.<delimiter>And pretty Ilzbute, their very youngest child,<delimiter>Had wed the chief commune of Taukiai bailiwick.<delimiter>That’s why her father gave such a grand wedding ball<delimiter>And spared no means to make the party a success.<delimiter>The butcher slew two oxen, three fat barren cows,<delimiter>And did not even count the pigs and sheep he killed.<delimiter>One chicken and one goose escaped his deadly knife.
Hams, loins, and other cuts, sliced up in different ways,<delimiter>Krizas’ resourceful chef steamed, fried and broiled so much,<delimiter>The bubbling of the pots and pans was long and loud,<delimiter>And caused Pauluks, next door, to fear a village fire.<delimiter>As he was pouring soups and gravies into bowls<delimiter>And pulling out with hooks the roasts from the hot stove,<delimiter>Chef Petras glowed with pride in his supreme success,<delimiter>And urged the waiters to feed well the hungry guests.<delimiter>Tuse rushed in with thin homewoven tablecloths<delimiter>And set a lengthy table in a wedding style.<delimiter>Then the inviters hasened in with steaming food:<delimiter>Rich pork and sizzling steaks, and chicken, goose and duck;<delimiter>Large hams, thick sausages, and many kinds of meats.
After the wedding guests said “Our Father” piously,<delimiter>As faithful Christians do, and settled for the feast,<delimiter>Kind Krizas urged each one not to conserve the food<delimiter>And to enjoy the bracing drinks to please their souls.<delimiter>Enskys at once pulled out his well-worn hunting knife<delimiter>And started to carve out large cuts of luscious meats.<delimiter>Unskilled in carving art, as people often are,<delimiter>With awkward fingers he seized oozing chunks of meats<delimiter>And dumped them in the plates of the astounded guests;<delimiter>His manners were no boon to the gay wedding feast.<delimiter>And many others, too, well filled with mead and wine,<delimiter>Could scarcely see what they had on their high-heaped plates;<delimiter>Still others boorishly used not their knives and forks,<delimiter>But took chunks in their hands and gobbled breathlessly,<delimiter>While the hot juices trickled down their bobbing chins.<delimiter>The guests thought that the host did not expect that they<delimiter>Should bow, eat and behave as lords and ladies do.
As the gay feast went on, and the boors ate and drank,<delimiter>Krizas gave out a shout; his servants right away<delimiter>Brought in on a litter a keg of potent beer;<delimiter>The groomsmen all at once with pitchers, jugs and mugs<delimiter>Began to draw and pour the effervescent brew;<delimiter>Of course, fermented beer bemoistens dry palate<delimiter>And soon fills up the stomach with thick foam of malt.
Alas, the wedding guests, well stuffed with heavy food<delimiter>And amply filled with drinks, forgot to thank the Lord,<delimiter>As pious Christians do after each daily meal;<delimiter>But — ’tis a shame to tell it — they, like loutish swine,<delimiter>Began their brazen tales and their indecent songs.<delimiter>Stepas told many lies about the lusty steeds,<delimiter>Enskys praised to the skies elegant oxen teams,<delimiter>And then the twain played tricks and laughed all by themselves.<delimiter>Lauras began to blow and tingle his jew’s-harp,<delimiter>And Kubas tuned and scraped his squeaky violin.<delimiter>Just then Docys, much overfilled with food and drinks,<delimiter>Like an old Polish bag, rolled off the wooden bench —<delimiter>The guests became upset and terrified; but then<delimiter>He, on a stretcher, half-alive, was fetched outside.
Some of the women their sly cunning then displayed,<delimiter>And rather smartly, too, for woman’s wit is quick,<delimiter>It oftentimes ensnares e’en the most brilliant man.<delimiter>Lauriene, Pakuliene, Berge and Pime,<delimiter>While at the table, looked askance at mead and wine,<delimiter>And even downed Kriziene as she served the drinks<delimiter>And offered the degrading liquids to the girls.<delimiter>But hark, my friend, what later these deceivers did.<delimiter>The sly intriguers soon slipped out to a quiet nook,<delimiter>Where they had hid a flask of whiskey beforehand;<delimiter>There round by rapid round they drained the bottle dry,<delimiter>And then they used rash words, tattled offensive tales,<delimiter>And deeply shamed the decent girls and women there.<delimiter>Pime and Barbe sang a song about the hurds,<delimiter>While Pakuliene and Lauriene praised their hens.<delimiter>Dake sang of her geese, Jeke — about her ducks,<delimiter>And each one strived hard to outsing the rest of them.<delimiter>The quieter women sat aside in their own group<delimiter>And chatted all about their homes and families.<delimiter>You know the women’s way: they always talk and talk,<delimiter>Wherever they may meet, but seldom say a thing.
As the guests spoke and sang, the orchestra convened,<delimiter>Took out their instruments and struck a boorish tune.<delimiter>Plyckius twanged cymbal; Kubas scraped his violin;<delimiter>Znairiuks, with face puffed out, played his old wooden fife.<delimiter>Enskys now called upon the smiling country girls<delimiter>To come forward and dance with the proud rustic men.<delimiter>Klisis, with ugly boots, rushed up and seized Pime;<delimiter>Kairiuks, with wooden shoes, dragged Tuse to the floor,<delimiter>Where they twirled, jumped and kicked in good Lithuanian style.<delimiter>Some jesters purposely wore their outworn bast shoes;<delimiter>Some shoeless and some coatless made amusing pranks.<delimiter>You know how the slow boors, when filled with food and drinks<delimiter>At weddings improvise all kinds of clowning jests.
But listen now and hear what else ere long occured:<delimiter>Among the guests appeared two uninvited men,<delimiter>The twain were Slunkius and Peleda, whom you know.<delimiter>Krizas confronted them with harsh and angry words;<delimiter>His wife, because of that, fell ill with belly-ache,<delimiter>And moaned unceasingly. But Krizas still went on:<delimiter>” Tis shame, ’tis brazen shame for you men to sneak in,<delimiter>Where but invited guests are being entertained!<delimiter>How dare you enter here where you are wanted not?<delimiter>Be gone, and do not come again into this house,<delimiter>Until you are informed that you are welcome here!”<delimiter>Because of this tumult the guests were so upset<delimiter>That they grew silent, did not move, and did not smoke;<delimiter>Some men feared trouble so that e’en their pipes they dropped.<delimiter>And the musicians, too, became so terrified<delimiter>That with their instruments they crawled beneath the beds.<delimiter>The twirling dancing ceased; the raucous songs died down;<delimiter>There was no word, no sound, no motion in the house.<delimiter>The songs about the roosters, chickens, ducks and geese,<delimiter>The tales about the horses, oxen, bears and wolves,<delimiter>Because of this encounter, ended all at once.<delimiter>The frightened guests just stood and held their very breath,<delimiter>Not knowing what to do in the exigency —<delimiter>Until enraged Enskys picked up a birchen rod<delimiter>And beat both Slunkius and Peleda black and blue —<delimiter>Then grabbed each by the hair and threw them both outside.
Now do not take alarm at such an uncouth scene.<delimiter>Lords, in their own proud way, often are drunken too,<delimiter>And then they, just like we, play boorish tricks and laugh.<delimiter>It’s true, many a boor is rude and rough and crude,<delimiter>And oft at gatherings his talk is coarse and vile,<delimiter>And shames the wedding ball or the baptismal feast;<delimiter>But do not think that lords and ladies of high rank<delimiter>Speak but in accents sweet and of but holy things.<delimiter>A drunkard even among them, when temulent,<delimiter>Is not ashamed to blab the boorish brazen tales.
Said Prickus, “Well, since I became the chief commune,<delimiter>I’ve seen a lot of our high lordlings and their deeds;<delimiter>Oh, I’ve watched them much — how they eat, and drink and dance..<delimiter>Of late it fell to me to take a document<delimiter>Prom a high lord to a most high official,<delimiter>And at the latter’s house I saw and heard strange things.<delimiter>I, as a servant should, walked in without a cap,<delimiter>Bowed low, and in my hand I held the lordly scroll;<delimiter>Relieved of it soon, I crept into the cuisine,<delimiter>To see what kind of bites were being baked and steamed.<delimiter>Long being used to mix among them as a friend,<delimiter>I had no fear of rich or of high-ranking men.<delimiter>Here three befattened cooks appeared before my eyes:<delimiter>One sluggard was eviscerating a black hawk;<delimiter>Another, tearing with his nails an outstreched hare,<delimiter>Was clearing nests of curling worms from the entrails;<delimiter>The third, with two ungainly ladles in his hands,<delimiter>Into a steaming pot was packing ugly frogs —<delimiter>The delicacies that the rich enjoy so much.
“As I looked on, so queasy did my stomach grow,<delimiter>That I rushed through the door and there I vomited.<delimiter>Then after throwing up, I tiptoed in again,<delimiter>And uttered not a word about my nausea.<delimiter>You know how the rich fools would have derided me,<delimiter>Or even pulled my hair and boxed my boorish ears.<delimiter>So I just hid myself behind a massive door,<delimiter>All eyes and ears to learn how nobles talk and dine.<delimiter>Ere long the chefs had cooked these newest kinds of food,<delimiter>That filled the manor house with an offensive stench.<delimiter>The lordly servants soon appeared in an array,<delimiter>Placed on the table many things that dight the feast,<delimiter>And brought in all kinds of boiled, broiled and sodden foods.<delimiter>Poor I with hands beclasped, as pious peasants do,<delimiter>Was waiting for a deep and solemn lordly prayer.<delimiter>But lo! The sorry lot just flopped down in the chairs;<delimiter>Without the thought of Heav’n they took the spoons in hand,<delimiter>And, yapping all the while, stuck food into their mouths.
“Having not seen such nastiness in all my life,<delimiter>I was so shocked that I almost cried out aloud.<delimiter>But realizing that I had no right to shout,<delimiter>I stood and uttered imprecations silently,<delimiter>And yet so fervently, the dogs began to growl.<delimiter>Said I, ‘You useless sots, you godless epicures!<delimiter>Are you ashamed to lift your sinful eyes to God<delimiter>And say a humble prayer before you gorge fat chunks?<delimiter>We, soiled and worn out boors; we, bast-shod simpletons —<delimiter>Though we are overburdened, scolded and abused —<delimiter>Though oftentimes we eat but watered crusts of bread,<delimiter>Though we refresh our hearts with weak and tasteless brew,<delimiter>Yet e’en for such scant gifts we daily thank the Lord.<delimiter>But you vile parasites, who daily eat rich food,<delimiter>And strain into your bellies costly Rhenish wine,<delimiter>Neglect to thank the Lord for wealth and luxury.<delimiter>Have you no fear that you might choke on caviar,<delimiter>Or that the lightning might reduce your homes to dust?’<delimiter>All that I whispered low, then given a dispatch<delimiter>To carry back with me, provoked and terrified<delimiter>I rushed out through the door and rode back to my home.”
Said Selmas, “Yes, indeed, these are indecent times,<delimiter>Full of all kinds of wrongs and base roguery.<delimiter>Yea; lord and servant, both are headed straight for hell.<delimiter>The lord, puffed-up with pride of his great influence,<delimiter>Is too ashamed to speak of Him who rules all things; ,<delimiter>The serf, bent low to please his liege, speaks ill of God.<delimiter>Blind lords, who dumbly play into the devil’s hands,<delimiter>Lead their own servants, too, along infernal ways.<delimiter>The Lord and Holy Writ, the churches and the faith —<delimiter>High hymns and pious psalms, fasts, offerings and prayers —<delimiter>To these apostates smell like rotting barn manure.<delimiter>Blinded by cards and comedies the errant lords<delimiter>Leave their dissolute servants to transgress and laugh.<delimiter>O what’s become of decency these sorry days!”
And as the tales died down — the guests were set to leave —<delimiter>A bas-shod servitor of Bleberis rushed in,<delimiter>Asqualling: “Men, rejoice! New feasts are coming soon!<delimiter>Hear how Bendikas kills a gander in a shed,<delimiter>And Paikzentis slaughters a fattened full-grown ram.<delimiter>And Vauskus, yonder, slays his single horned bull,<delimiter>While Mikols in the garden singes butchered shoat<delimiter>With flaming straw — the smoke for miles beclouds the skies<delimiter>And dims the sun, the stars, and e’en the frigid moon.<delimiter>There’ll be a rich supply of sausages and meats!<delimiter>Many a seasoned ham and side of bacon sweet<delimiter>Beneath the roofs of thrifty boors are being smoked,<delimiter>And yet still more of meats are being drest and cured.<delimiter>Again we’ll eat and drink in good Lithuanian style —<delimiter>Forgetting woes and cares, we will repair our health!”
But pray, do not assume on hearing these strange tales<delimiter>That they are told as just droll stories on ourselves.<delimiter>Nay, nay; too much in our green fields we bend our backs;<delimiter>Too fast we rush and run while doing our mean tasks.<delimiter>We fetch and spread manure, we plow and sow the soil;<delimiter>We mow and make the hay and store it ‘neath the roof.<delimiter>We gather Earth’s new wealth into each barn and shed.<delimiter>Our work is arduous, our life ir sorrowful.<delimiter>Too oft the drenching rains pour on our ill-clad backs;<delimiter>Too oft the blazing sun beats down on our poor heads.<delimiter>Many a day we eat insipid, tasteless meals,<delimiter>Many a day we have naught but dry crusts of bread;<delimiter>Many a time we sip but weak, ill-tasting soup,<delimiter>Many a time we drink stale water from a pool.<delimiter>Many a day we sweat, many a night we grieve;<delimiter>And all the while sad tears furrow our care-worn cheeks.<delimiter>We are the indigent and overburdened souls!
And now that we are through with our hard summer tasks,<delimiter>Let’s get together now and hold a merry feast.<delimiter>For such a purpose God gave us abundant wealth,<delimiter>And we, who are worn out by never-ending tasks,<delimiter>Must now regain our strength by crunching tasty cuts.<delimiter>As work we must, since God told all of us to eat,<delimiter>So eat we must that we may stay in proper health.<delimiter>Then let’s not hesitate to kill and slay our food.<delimiter>Man, slaughter right away that young befattened ox;<delimiter>Slay few sheep and, too, spare not that hornless ram;<delimiter>Put chickens, ducks and geese into that big clay pot;<delimiter>Then butcher those gray shoats, and that corpulant sow;<delimiter>Eat to your precious health homemade groats blood pudding,<delimiter>Take chitterlings and fat and make fresh condiments.<delimiter>If that does not suffice, then take a goodly tripe<delimiter>And stuff it with chopped lungs until it almost bursts.<delimiter>Too, make a lot of that so useful liverwurst:<delimiter>For such conserves will prove to be a handy thing.<delimiter>Remember, many springs are very long and lean.<delimiter>Is not it nice to taste some crispy bacon strips<delimiter>While pitching the manure or harvesting the crops,<delimiter>Or to munch seethed ham while doing work indoors?
“Yea,” Lauras said, “meats should be handled frugally.<delimiter>Good sense is needed in the fall when meats are cured,<delimiter>And reason should be followed when the meats are used.<delimiter>Is it a proper thing for folk of meager means<delimiter>To eat but ham and pork as soon as the fall comes,<delimiter>And in the taverns drink away their little wealth?<delimiter>Now, you have heard of late how indiscreet Docys,<delimiter>By spending lavishly and drinking senselessly,<delimiter>Lost all his earthly wealth and turned into a tramp.<delimiter>Boy, as you eat and drink, fail not to be discreet.<delimiter>The year has many days; each day is slow and long,<delimiter>And each requires its share of needed nutriment.<delimiter>Each day the breakfast, lunch and supper rolls around<delimiter>And calls for food to pacify the stomach’s groans.<delimiter>And then the rest breaks, too, many an afternoon,<delimiter>When farm tasks multiply, gape for some tasty snacks.
“Then feast not constantly, as if each day you’d hold<delimiter>A wedding ball or a baptismal gathering.<delimiter>Nay; do not entertain your stomach ev’ry day,<delimiter>And waste not foolishly your scanty food supplies;<delimiter>Be sure your meats and fats will last the whole year through.<delimiter>Now, parsnips, carrots, squash, dill pickles, radishes,<delimiter>Beets, rutabagas, cole, beet tops, peas, sauerkraut,<delimiter>And lima beans, when cooked with proper seasoning —<delimiter>Well—balanced buckwheat hash and tasty barley groats,<delimiter>As well as oatmeal pap, when boiled in a clean pot;<delimiter>Potatoes, too, when cooked in many different styles,<delimiter>With mushrooms, fish, and spice, as added flavoring —<delimiter>Indeed, make tempting food, as well as healthful meals.<delimiter>But these, too, must be saved and eaten sparingly,<delimiter>Remembering that there will be more hungry days.
“And be not irked, my friend, if I still add a word.<delimiter>Among Lithuanians oft a stinker comes along,<delimiter>And by his bawdy words or by his rowdy acts,<delimiter>Shames us as much as any German snob could do.<delimiter>Many a time our men drink much more than they should,<delimiter>Sing smutty German songs, use vulgar German words,<delimiter>And hasten to the inns as fast as Germans do.<delimiter>Such gawks spend all their means on whiskey, wine, and beer,<delimiter>Then, ragged, tramp around and cause us all to blush.<delimiter>You useless wastrels, do you think that God gives us<delimiter>His precious gifts and His abundant earthly wealth<delimiter>So that we may devour them like unsated hogs?<delimiter>Of course, the belly must be kept in cheerful mood<delimiter>But also it must be discreetly covered up.”
Quoth lisping Buzas, “Yes, indeed, that is the truth.<delimiter>We know that all of us were born without a thread:<delimiter>Most wealthy feudal lord, as we, the bast-shod boors,<delimiter>Exhalted emperor, as his betattered thralls,<delimiter>Barefooted mendicant, as crafty nobleman,<delimiter>Each babbled stupidly and sucked his mother’s breast.<delimiter>The rich in silks, the poor in rags, shed bitter tears,<delimiter>And painfully each learns to reason properly.<delimiter>Yes; babes both rich and poor all mess themselves alike,<delimiter>And in the selfsame way are wiped off with a clout —<delimiter>And in the same brook are washed out their swaddling clothes.<delimiter>I hope I do not shock you with my homely words,<delimiter>As I speak but the truth in plain and simple terms.
“Each human being painfully begins to gape,<delimiter>When from the darkness he rolls out into the light<delimiter>And dreaming in the crib calls for his mother’s help:<delimiter>One like the other child is powerless when born.<delimiter>Whether born to the rich and tucked in feather beds,<delimiter>Or born a lowly boor and stuck in some dark nook,<delimiter>Or swaddled in old rags and laid on the hard straw,<delimiter>How little any babe may claim that is his own!<delimiter>As yet no lord was born with a sword at his side,<delimiter>Nor any newborn boor dragged out with him a plow —<delimiter>Or harrow parts, or e’en a lone tooth of a rake.<delimiter>And yet the lordlings vain parade before the boors,<delimiter>Like bacon fat atop the boiling water floats;<delimiter>While the exhausted boor, with his worn cap removed,<delimiter>As if by lightning lashed, by the cold oven quakes,<delimiter>Or bows down to the ground before an idle lord.<delimiter>But God distinctly marked to ev’ry man his place,<delimiter>And so one like a prince displays his peacock crest;<delimiter>Another wades in feculence and digs manure.
“Many unthinking gawks of malevolent heart<delimiter>Regard the weary boors as sensless simpletons,<delimiter>And yet oft times themselves behave and talk as such.<delimiter>Who for the idlers would produce the sapid foods<delimiter>And drinks, and would take care of all their daily needs —<delimiter>And who would till the soil and gather in the crops,<delimiter>Or thresh the golden grain and cart it to be sold,<delimiter>Without such men as Lauras, Krizas and Enskys?<delimiter>Many a foolish lord in the first autumn days<delimiter>Eats up and wastes his ample food supplies, and then,<delimiter>Distressed, he shoves a coin into some kinds boor’s hand<delimiter>And humbly pleads for food, his hunger to relieve;<delimiter>Then with his belly full struts like a potentate,<delimiter>Inhumanly torments the tenderhearted wretch,<delimiter>Or sneeringly derides the peasant’s modest home.”
Said Prickus, “Yes, indeed, I meet such rascals, too,<delimiter>When I, as chief commune, patrol my bailiwick.<delimiter>The chief damns me so much that e’en my hair stands up.<delimiter>Boors, too, deride my name and curse me thoroughly.<delimiter>My boss scolds me each day and tells me I’m too lax;<delimiter>And if I fail to do his hest, he beats my head<delimiter>So hard that the snot squirts from out my pallid nose.<delimiter>This causes me great pain, and e’en a greater shame —<delimiter>Especially when a serf sees; for then he laughs<delimiter>And disobeys me, his kind-hearted chief commune —<delimiter>And even spits on me and scorns me like a horse.<delimiter>If privately my boss would even skin my hide,<delimiter>But publicly he would defend and honor me,<delimiter>Then though my flesh would ache, my soul would be content.<delimiter>But now I am the butt of ridicule by all —<delimiter>Now e’en the children jeer and laugh right in my face.
“The other day, as chief commune, I rode around<delimiter>On my patrol, and I lashed lazy Slunkius’ back.<delimiter>He screamed — and jumped to beat me and to pull my hair —<delimiter>‘Leave me alone, you snot! I’ll flatten out your ears!<delimiter>Have you forgotten how the boss lashed out your hide?’<delimiter>His words humiliated me so terribly,<delimiter>I wished there was a place to hide my reddened face —<delimiter>And all the more, because the serfs sang jeering songs.<delimiter>When this ordeal was over, I was much undone.<delimiter>Just as the springtime snow, despoiled by wind and rain,<delimiter>Though present here and there, is useless to the sledge,<delimiter>So I thenceforth was an abased and abject man.
“But, ah, when I was young — where are those happy days? —<delimiter>When I was young and strong, all people honored me.<delimiter>Whether a lord, a boor, a servant, or a maid —<delimiter>A pantsless child, a babe still suckling at the breast —<delimiter>By one and all I was admired and honored well.<delimiter>But now, when I am old, all hail me as a fool;<delimiter>Both rich and poor alike defame the chief commune.<delimiter>Each morning as I groom and saddle my old nag,<delimiter>I see there on his neck his worn and tattered mane,<delimiter>I sigh heart-stricken at the thought of my old age;<delimiter>Then when I ride upon his back in lashing rain,<delimiter>And he plods faithfully down the wet, winding road,<delimiter>I pity him so much that tears come to my eyes —<delimiter>And all the more if I have just been beaten up.<delimiter>Just think: I care that much for my old senseless beast,<delimiter>On whose back for twelve years I’ve ridden far and wide,<delimiter>And made uncounted trips throughout the bailiwick.<delimiter>But I — Lord pity me, the hoary chief commune —<delimiter>Know no sincere respect and hear no word of praise!”
“Look here,” spoke up Enskys, unsheathing a large knife,<delimiter>“My tender-hearted friend, why do you prate and frown?<delimiter>To you, just like to me, oft falls such a remorse.<delimiter>This elk-horn-handled knife, forged on an anvil cold,<delimiter>You see it bears the shape of a pale waning moon,<delimiter>Or even of the harsh, old eagle’s crooked beak.<delimiter>Each time I hold this knife, I see the ruthless Death —<delimiter>Just as the artist’s hand so vividly portrays —<delimiter>With the slaughterous scythe, that chills the hearts of men.<delimiter>My friend, for this old knife, this worn and blunted knife,<delimiter>I feel so sorry that I oft can’t hold my tears.<delimiter>Because for thirteen years with it I have sliced pork<delimiter>And sausages at parties, feasts and wedding balls;<delimiter>It slipped through goodly chunks of meats with graceful ease,<delimiter>And even split the ribs and bones like a sharp ax,<delimiter>As Mikas and Docys will readily attest.
“But that is not the end; I’ll tell you even more.<delimiter>Well, I — just listen brother, what befell to me,<delimiter>And what quite oft befalls to many boors each year,<delimiter>When they proceed to make the new bast shoes they need,<delimiter>Or when they feel an urge to hunt for tasty game.<delimiter>Oh I, a stupid knave, acting uncautiously,<delimiter>Into the forest slipped to steel bast, logs, and wood.<delimiter>Of course, many a time the forester caught me,<delimiter>And, having thrashed me well like any wretched thief,<delimiter>Each time he, like a rogue, deprived me of my ax;<delimiter>But luckily he never took my horse — not yet.<delimiter>And, too, I did not steal as some low rascals do,<delimiter>Who in the winter sneak into the forests wide,<delimiter>Chop down but mighty oaks and sturdy maple trees,<delimiter>Then lug the stolen logs down to the nearest town,<delimiter>Then sell them and drink up all their ill-gotten gains.<delimiter>Whenever I stole wood, or any other thing,<delimiter>Nay, I was not ashamed to stretch my hand for it,<delimiter>Because I stole not for myself, but for the lords.<delimiter>You know how sweet it is to pay the yearly scot<delimiter>To the cheftains when due; else, the mean watchmen call<delimiter>And squeeze us, until they squeeze out the cash from us.
“Ah, my dear brother, please be not surprised at me,<delimiter>Nor tell the forester that Obrys, my hired hand,<delimiter>Each autumn makes many a trip for stealing wood.<delimiter>I beam with pleasure when he does these tasks for me.<delimiter>Each time he takes my team to the forbidden woods,<delimiter>Delightfully I give him two large sausages;<delimiter>And each time he returns uncaught by the woodsman,<delimiter>Then gladly I present the third sausage to him —<delimiter>Or, if the sausages are gone, I give a cheese.<delimiter>And then, when we’ve built up a goodly pile of wood,<delimiter>We take it load by load to town and sell it there,<delimiter>And save the hard-earned pennies for such yearly needs<delimiter>As contributions, sundry dues and excise tax.<delimiter>And so you see, the theft of wood requires good sense.<delimiter>It is but clumsy fools who, by their stealing wood,<delimiter>Or smuggling bundles of tobacco banned by law,<delimiter>Bring on themselves great shame and painful punishment.<delimiter>Besides, among the boors there are some renegades,<delimiter>Who, having eaten up their pork and sausages<delimiter>For a mere sip of rye or a quaff of stale brew,<delimiter>Yea, sink so low, they lie and falsify like Jews.
“Now in the thorp where I each day cook my old pot,<delimiter>Two scoundrels live in their dilapidated shacks.<delimiter>One of the twain is called Peleda by the serfs;<delimiter>The other bears the name Slunkius — a nickname.<delimiter>We all know boors at times invent fantastic tales,<delimiter>And all the more when drunk at feasts and wedding balls,<delimiter>When in a swinish way they start their loutish jests.<delimiter>I built my new house here only a year ago,<delimiter>And therefore I as yet know not my neighbors well,<delimiter>And know not all about their virtues and their faults;<delimiter>But of Peleda and of Slunkius I have heard —<delimiter>And what I heard of them made my knees shake in fear.<delimiter>Just listen, brother, and you will hear such strange things<delimiter>That will make your gray hair stand up on your old head.
“Those stinkers have such huts, that when you look at them<delimiter>They seem to be but ugly piles of wood and straw.<delimiter>When you look up you see the disarrayed thatch roofs,<delimiter>Torn up by storm and gale and twisted by harsh winds,<delimiter>With many loosened patches falling to the ground.<delimiter>Beneath the roof the rotted beams and gables sway,<delimiter>And hanging strips of boards, tied with old rags and bast<delimiter>To the decaying rafters, dangle here and there.<delimiter>And when you cast your eyes down inside these foul huts,<delimiter>You see but weather-beaten, tumble-down pig pens:<delimiter>In ev’ry nook and corner garbage and manure.<delimiter>Those two are not ashamed to keep pigs in their homes,<delimiter>And if you criticize, they’ll curse you long and loud.
“The other day I met Peleda on the road,<delimiter>Whereat I spoke to him about his swinishness<delimiter>And as a neighbor, gave him sensible advice.<delimiter>Said I, ‘You filthy pig, have you no shame at all?<delimiter>You, like a tumblebug, wade in the filthy muck,<delimiter>So now you even smell like a foul tumblebug.<delimiter>Some days ago I passed by your unsightly shack,<delimiter>And so I stopped by it to take a closer look.<delimiter>As there I stood and watched, my horse gave out a neigh;<delimiter>A rafter tumbled down from your ramshackle house,<delimiter>And window panes began to rattle, crack, and fall.<delimiter>Inside the house — mind you what I am telling now —<delimiter>Three lean, blackspotted sows with their blackspotted young,<delimiter>As in a slaghterhouse, began to squeak and squeal,<delimiter>Then through the windows they jumped outside one by one.
“‘I, never having seen such things in all my life,<delimiter>Was so surprised the hair stood right up on my head!<delimiter>Peleda, you foul thing, with Slunkius, your vile friend,<delimiter>You both should be ashamed to mix with decent men.<delimiter>Neither of you is fit even to herd the pigs,<delimiter>And yet you always strut around like noblemen,<delimiter>And take the foremost seats at ev’ry gathering —<delimiter>And always grab more food and drinks than is your share.<delimiter>If the authorities did their duties to us,<delimiter>They’d banish both of you from here forevermore!<delimiter>Because of you we, too, begin to smell like you.’<delimiter>This much to him I said. Then he picked up a club;<delimiter>With murder in his eyes, he hastened toward me,<delimiter>And if good Selmas had not been there at my side,<delimiter>Indeed, he would have clubbed my head right then and there.<delimiter>You see, my friends, how easily a brawl can start,<delimiter>When you attempt to teach a rascal how to live,<delimiter>And in your teaching dare to scold and upbraid him.”
As these tales and the wedding ball were at an end,<delimiter>The ground and ev’rything began to shake and sway;<delimiter>The worn and drowsy guests became so terrified,<delimiter>That they at once rushed for the door and tumbled out —<delimiter>And in the push and squeeze, some of them lost their eyes,<delimiter>While others suffered fractures of their arms and legs.<delimiter>The cause of this mad rush was but a trifling thing:<delimiter>Dodys and his six men, while threshing in the barn,<delimiter>Were striking with their flails the pea vines with such force,<delimiter>That e’en the mice beneath the straw dared not to budge,<delimiter>And many of the guests unto themselves caused harm.
Oh, do not be surprised on hearing such strange tales,<delimiter>Because Docys each year, when the fall season comes,<delimiter>While threshing his crops, scares the villagers to death.<delimiter>Alas! Last year, enraged, he ruined many a home,<delimiter>And laid to utter waste many a timberland.<delimiter>’Tis sad when Lauras, the uncle of Bleberis,<delimiter>Recounts the grave misdeeds done to him by Docys.<delimiter>For just a pigsty and a storehouse still remain;<delimiter>But of his modest home only the charred ruins stare.
Such foul activities of the uncouth Docys<delimiter>Many a brawl and fight brought among peaceful men.<delimiter>Many a decent man forsook his happy home<delimiter>And in the cold fall days sought refuge in the fields,<delimiter>Or made himself a sack and went to beg for alms.<delimiter>About Docys’ affrays many a villager<delimiter>Complained to the Karaliaucius officials,<delimiter>But none ever received a suitable redress.<delimiter>Good God! How well we know how this sardonic age<delimiter>Walks past our bitter tears with a contemptuous smile!
But still we know not why Docys behaves like that,<delimiter>Nor yet why with his flail he beats the crops so hard.<delimiter>Many a man, who ate the mixed mass of Docys,<delimiter>Has said that Docys bangs so much his sagging barn<delimiter>That it should yield something for drinks and revelry.<delimiter>Right after Michaelmas he starts to thresh his crops,<delimiter>Keeps licking his lips and looks at the tavern door.<delimiter>And then when he has threshed a liffle precious grain,<delimiter>At once he winnows it, fills up a sack or two,<delimiter>And runs to a pothouse to drink and to carouse.<delimiter>And often his wife, too, takes fascicles of flax,<delimiter>Then sells them secretly and sips the bracing drinks.<delimiter>And that is not enough. She takes the children, too;<delimiter>Puts them in her man’s lap, and drinks along with him.
Last year when Kasparas, the hand of Bleberis,<delimiter>Went along with Docys to visit Plauciunas,<delimiter>Krizas and Lauras, too, arrived at the same time.<delimiter>For then Plauciunas had invited all his friends<delimiter>And neighbors to his child’s baptismal gathering.<delimiter>At first invited guests assembled in the house;<delimiter>Then uninvited men sneaked in and milled around.<delimiter>As soon as Krizas came, Kasparas greeted him;<delimiter>But Docys walked right by like some important lord,<delimiter>And then paced up and down mumbling obscenities.<delimiter>He’d brought a great thirst and a mighty appetite,<delimiter>And smacked his lips at sight and smell of food and drinks.<delimiter>Plauciunas’ servants soon brought in all kinds of foods<delimiter>And homemade barley cakes for the baptismal guests,<delimiter>And the guests seated in variegated lines<delimiter>Plauciunas’ soups and pork heartily ate and praised.
All the guests quietly dined and chatted merrily,<delimiter>But Lauras and Docys were mumbling constantly<delimiter>About the fallen down and sagging piggeries,<delimiter>And soon began to curse and argue angrily.<delimiter>Keep still, you reprobates! Is it a proper thing<delimiter>To spoil the feast with talk about the piggeries?<delimiter>But hear what else took place at that baptismal feast,<delimiter>As good old Krizas has told us a year ago:
“Plauciunas bought three kegs of rare and costly beer,<delimiter>And told his men to tap them in the dining room.<delimiter>Enskys, his knave, brought in tall pitchers and large mugs,<delimiter>And many, many stoups of colorful design.<delimiter>Ere long the guests drained out a large barrel of beer,<delimiter>And started to converse in brazen boorish way.<delimiter>You know how a dumb boor, befilled with alcohol,<delimiter>Is not ashamed to tell all kinds of stupid things.<delimiter>By now the others, too, about the piggeries,<delimiter>And e’en about the slaughtered pigs, began to prate.<delimiter>Because of ugly words, pronounced in piggish ways,<delimiter>A hellish turbulence and violence arose.
“They say that a drunk boor becomes bereft of mind,<delimiter>But also he forgets all bounds of decency.<delimiter>So now Plauciunas, too, the host of this affair,<delimiter>Was host to so much beer that he became blear-eyed,<delimiter>And, looking at the lamp, he could not see the light.<delimiter>Is it a wonder that his friends, well fed and wined,<delimiter>Did not appreciate the sponsor’s decent talk?<delimiter>And that’s not all the tale; hark to what happened next:
“Lauras, the son-in-law of gentle Kasparas,<delimiter>Kubas, and Mykolas — the district overseer —<delimiter>With other rowdy friends, made battle on Docys.<delimiter>Like vicious dogs they fought, and in their blood and gore<delimiter>Rolled on the slushy floor and bashed each other so,<delimiter>That some had noses smashed and others ears torn off.<delimiter>Docys was far the worst; he was so badly mauled,<delimiter>That his boys brought him home in a trough nearly dead.
“His faithful wife, Pime, was shocked and horrified;<delimiter>She took him in her arms and, shedding bitter tears,<delimiter>She washed his battered skull and cleansed and dried his wounds.<delimiter>The village women soon came running to her aid,<delimiter>And brought along all kinds of charms and medicines.<delimiter>Gryta came with a cut of helicompany;<delimiter>Selmyke and Berge brought many kinds of salves.<delimiter>All of them aghast ran to give aid to Docys.<delimiter>Jeke, while grating all those potent herbs and roots,<delimiter>Admixed Dutch myrtle leaves and Polish axle tar;<delimiter>This balm befilled the house with a mephitic smell,<delimiter>That caused Docys to gasp and show a sign of life.
“His tearful wife, Pime, with other female friends,<delimiter>Rubbed and massaged Docys with their strong remedies,<delimiter>And were about to dress his deep and painful wounds —<delimiter>As Pakuliene rose to break with charms the spell<delimiter>That lay now on Docys. He smelled the witchcraft fumes<delimiter>And sensed the sorcery they were performing there.<delimiter>Upsetting his bed, he leaped like a thunderbolt<delimiter>Clear out of it, raging, seized a long birchen club<delimiter>And chased the female quacks out of the fulsome house.<delimiter>With all their magic herbs and exorcising drugs,<delimiter>Then having smashed so many household utensils,<delimiter>And having thrown out pots with loathsome liniments,<delimiter>Still raging mad, he almost killed his children, too,<delimiter>Who had washed his mauled body of unseemly gore.”
“Indeed now,” Selmas spoke, “of stories that’s enough!<delimiter>Enough of those old tales! Our ears begin to ache.<delimiter>Oh, what became of those good, old Lithuanian days,<delimiter>When Prussians did not speak the strident German tongue,<delimiter>And did not wear high boots and shiny leather shoes,<delimiter>But daily donned bast shoes and wore them pridefully?<delimiter>In those days no one downed his neighbors or his friends,<delimiter>Nor was ashamed of them, nor of them falsely spake.<delimiter>But now, Lord pity us, it is a shame to see<delimiter>How our Lithuanian folk, like Germans, wear high boots<delimiter>And shoes when they appear at feasts and gatherings.
“And e’en the wooden shoes that Germans make and wear<delimiter>Meseems, are not the things for our Lithuanian folk:<delimiter>Our fathers and forefathers did not care for them;<delimiter>And when it comes to boots, invented by the French,<delimiter>And shoes, our sires were e’en ashamed to speak of them,<delimiter>Until the Frenchmen came to our beloved shore<delimiter>And taught us to accept their customs and their styles.
“In olden days our folk had no books and no schools;<delimiter>They were not taught their ABC’s nor Cathechism.<delimiter>They learned the Holy Script and Rule Divine by heart,<delimiter>Yet they obeyed and praised God oft and more than we,<delimiter>And went to church more faihfully on holy days.<delimiter>But nowadys, good God, it is a shame to see,<delimiter>How our Lithuanian folk, drest up in French attire,<delimiter>Just now and then drop in the church to show themselves,<delimiter>Then hasten to an inn to drink, carouse, and dance.<delimiter>Ere long many of them, well-filled with alcohol,<delimiter>Begin their boorish jokes and rough, indecent tales,<delimiter>Yea, with expressions never heard inside the church,<delimiter>Twist words into grossness and gossip wantonly.<delimiter>Some of them get into most asinine disputes;<delimiter>Blind drunk, they seize each other by the head or neck;<delimiter>Like dogs, they vomit on the floor and roll therein,<delimiter>Till the foul vomit spreys across the smelly room.<delimiter>The tale of such a sight makes one’s hair stand on end!
“That’s not the worst of it. Hard-drinking parents oft<delimiter>Drag their own brainless children to the filthy inns,<delimiter>And teach their youngsters drinking at their tender age;<delimiter>Then, as the tots look on, the parents stage a fight —<delimiter>Scratch one another’s face and pull each other’s hair.<delimiter>O ye barbarians! Ye godless imbeciles!<delimiter>Have you no fear that soon the hell will swallow you,<delimiter>For flaunting the Lord’s day at the debasing inns?<delimiter>Aren’t you ashamed to walk among good Christians?
“When priests urge that the children should be sent to schools,<delimiter>And ask for contributions for the teachers’ pay,<delimiter>Well, then all kinds of silly arguments arise;<delimiter>But when the chieftains levy the annual tax,<delimiter>And send the ruthless watchmen to collect the same,<delimiter>Then these same insolent, bewhiskered lunatics,<delimiter>As if the sky might fall, just give, and give, and give.<delimiter>But for the teachers, who are good and faithful men,<delimiter>In need of daily bread, the knaves no penny give,<delimiter>And then to justify themselves tell many lies.
“Paikius, who does not know e’en the Lord’s prayer too well,<delimiter>And his pal, Vauskus, who has never learned to read,<delimiter>Attempt to criticize our teachers and our schools.<delimiter>It is astonishing how loud these two can yell.<delimiter>The former rears his young in filth and ignorance;<delimiter>He damns them ev’ryday and leaves them to run wild;<delimiter>He vilifies the schools and downs the teachers, too,<delimiter>Because his imps at times are spanked on their behinds.<delimiter>The latter, hopelessly indined to deviltry,<delimiter>Prevents his children from attending the church school,<delimiter>And rears them for the greater pride and joy of hell.
“Now, Paikius blames the rain, while Vauskus damns the drought.<delimiter>One says it is too bright, another — ’tis too dark;<delimiter>Paikius condemns the school, Vauskus — the principal.<delimiter>One says the teacher is too stupid and too young;<delimiter>Another claims that he is too lax and too old.<delimiter>One says the teacher speaks too harshly and too loud;<delimiter>Another complains he does not scream loud enough.<delimiter>One holds him much too bold; another — much too shy.<delimiter>As they weigh teachers, so they measure clergymen.<delimiter>On Sundays, when the loose-tongued gossipers convene,<delimiter>Their first rite is to fill themselves with alcohol;<delimiter>Then they condemn the priests and execrate their deeds.”<delimiter>Of course, there is no lack of faithful Christians ,too.<delimiter>Most of Lithuanians are men of good character;<delimiter>They love their families, obey the will of God.<delimiter>Each day live saintly lives, steer clear of all misdeeds,<delimiter>And rule their modest homes with kind parental care.
Take men like Selmas, he is worthy of good praise.<delimiter>A boor nay, not a lord — but a fair-minded boor.<delimiter>His house is simple, just like any other boor’s;<delimiter>His food each day is plain, of meager seasoning;<delimiter>He only drinks root beer or water from a brook;<delimiter>He wears but homespun, three heald woven, linen garb,<delimiter>Or, in the winter time, a worn-out sheepskin coat.<delimiter>It’s not through penury he live so modestly,<delimiter>But to pay up the taxes to the government,<delimiter>And then to render to the school and church what’s due.<delimiter>Of course, you know full well the hardships of these times,<delimiter>How we are forced to live on beet soup and dry crusts.<delimiter>Therefore is it not good that Selmas, a plain boor,<delimiter>Discreetly manages to save a little bit?<delimiter>Besides, one does not have to tell how much he saves,<delimiter>Nor to disclose the place where he his savings keeps.<delimiter>In case you plan to visit Selmas’ modest home,<delimiter>Well, you will find it clean, and restful as a church.<delimiter>His table’s like the holy altar, neatly set,<delimiter>And on it rest many selected sacred books,<delimiter>So that, when all the daily doings have been done,<delimiter>Himself, or even his enlightened family,<delimiter>May read the Word of God, or sing the holy hymns,<delimiter>And ease the miseries of this oppressive life.
’Tis true that in this world, as the Scripture reveals,<delimiter>The true believers were always less numerous<delimiter>Than the irreverent and the ungodly men.<delimiter>And so ’twill always be, as long as blind mankind,<delimiter>Bereft of mind, will rush for the black gates of hell.<delimiter>So warned the patriarchs and holy men of old,<delimiter>And so said Christ, our Lord, and his disciples all:<delimiter>That ere doomsday the world will be in great tumult —<delimiter>That malevolent deeds will flourish ev’rywhere —<delimiter>And that among the lords and the downtrodden boors<delimiter>Base lies will triumph and depravity prevail.<delimiter>We witness ev’ryday how, reigning ev’rywhere,<delimiter>The devil fouls the hair of the malicious men.<delimiter>Awake ye, brethren, and see what is going on:<delimiter>How the infernal tide engulfs us from all sides,<delimiter>And how Lucifer, with his maleficent hordes,<delimiter>Is seizing listless hearts, seducing idle minds.<delimiter>To steal and deceive, to rob and to defraud,<delimiter>To drink and prostitute, to lie and abjure God —<delimiter>To propagate new schemes for perpetrating sin —<delimiter>That is the faith and creed of this unholy age!<delimiter>Alas! Whereto is bound this blind and greedy world?
We plain Lithuanians, ere we learned new ways of life,<delimiter>Were oft inclined to think that only Swiss and French<delimiter>Entangle human souls with their outlandish arts,<delimiter>And that only Germans are not ashamed to lie.<delimiter>But now, lo and behold, among Lithuanians, too,<delimiter>Of late, Lithuanian rogues and infidels appear,<delimiter>And cause disgrace and shame to our dear fatherland.<delimiter>O ye, Lithuanians, my beloved coutrymen,<delimiter>Prays do not fraternize with wanton heretics,<delimiter>And heed them not when those wrong-minded infidels<delimiter>Disparage you and play on you their wicked tricks.
So here, as a true boor, I’ve ventured to teach you,<delimiter>Without the smooth Germanic and French flattery;<delimiter>But in a rustic way, as your trustworthy friend,<delimiter>I’ve told you straight forward what I had on my mind.<delimiter>Yea, now Saint Martin’s feast is but a memory,<delimiter>The Advent is at hand, and Christmas soon will come.<delimiter>Look! From the glowing west, forceful and angry winds<delimiter>Are eastward moving with ferocious, headlong haste,<delimiter>And bringing biting frosts to our Lithuania dear.<delimiter>My friends, let’s to the house and build a glowing blaze.<delimiter>Let’s make the hovels, stalls, and stables weather-tight,<delimiter>So that no animal may freeze, nor shake with cold.<delimiter>For each domestic beast, when bitter winter comes,<delimiter>Submits itself to our solicitude and care,<delimiter>And looks with longing eyes to us for sustenance.<delimiter>So we must feed our stock, but feed it sensibly;<delimiter>For we know not how long the winter will abide,<delimiter>Nor what amount of feed we must reserve in store.<delimiter>Indeed, is it not well when winter fades away,<delimiter>And still there is a bit of provender left o’er?
And now, let’s take our leave and end this chattering!<delimiter>God grant that we full well enjoy the holy days,<delimiter>That in the best of health we hail the bright New Year,<delimiter>And meet and greet again as neighbors and good friends.
<h1>Winter Cares</h1>
Look yon! What great, fierce fangs the beast of winter bares!<delimiter>What sullen northern winds roll here to harry us!<delimiter>On the grim lakes and ponds translucent windows form,<delimiter>Like shining mirrors fashioned by a glazier’s hand.<delimiter>The pools, where swam the fish and leaped and dived the frogs,<delimiter>Because of winter’s threats, have put on armor plate,<delimiter>So now in dark retreats drowse all the water folk.<delimiter>See how the winter’s breath enthralls the barren fields,<delimiter>How lowland, swamp, and marsh all hard-fixed frowns take on,<delimiter>And how the mire has stubborn grown and ceased to splash.<delimiter>The dreary autumn roads, struck by the north wind’s might,<delimiter>Under the wagon wheels resound like kettle drums,<delimiter>And pound the human ear many a league away.<delimiter>So now the world salutes the winter on the march.
Yea, ’tis a proper time; the Yuletide feast is near,<delimiter>And the Advent in a few days will be no more.<delimiter>The autumn, like an elephant asplashing mire<delimiter>And rolling in the mud, had all of us worn out.<delimiter>While putting on bast shoes or pulling up high boots,<delimiter>We cursed the autumn rains and never-ending slush.<delimiter>Even the noble lords, racing by on horse back,<delimiter>Wrapped tight in rain-proof coats and wearing new high-boots,<delimiter>Splashed through the squashy mud and roundly cursed the fall.<delimiter>And so the populace, with eyes upon the north,<delimiter>Denounced the autumn’s mire and longed for winter’s haste.
As these complaints went on, the skies took on a glare;<delimiter>The northern winds began to race at reckless speed,<delimiter>And blew the rains to where the storks now idly drowse.<delimiter>Then through the mass of clouds old Winter stuck his head,<delimiter>And like a tyrant, doomed the autumn’s messy work;<delimiter>His chilling blasts wiped out the sodden ugliness.<delimiter>At once he frosted white and clean the fall’s manure,<delimiter>Built solid icy roads across the marshy swamps,<delimiter>And prompted all to change from tumbrel to a sledge.<delimiter>So now, where we before adored the happy spring<delimiter>And gladly gathered rainbow-colored buds and blooms,<delimiter>And where we later ended hearty summer joys,<delimiter>There now the drifting snow makes ranges of white hills,<delimiter>And winter’s fingers weave pearl blossoms on the bough.
How grand it is to see the tall bewhiskered pines,<delimiter>With their snow covered crests, remaining stoically,<delimiter>Like powdered gentlemen in dignified parade.<delimiter>But in their shade, like boors under a ledge of roof,<delimiter>The naked saplings, pinched by the relentless frosts<delimiter>And harried by the whistling winds, bow down and wail.<delimiter>And e’en the fallen trees and stumps become disturbed,<delimiter>As the north wind his mighty bellows puts to work<delimiter>And sifts, as with the sieves, the pearly dust of snow.<delimiter>Too, e’en the beasts of wood of late have disappeared.<delimiter>So as the cold winds rage and the air changes clash,<delimiter>Some animals are nestling in their wind-tight lairs,<delimiter>While others cower high up in the trees and drowse.
Ye animals and birds, it falls on you and us;<delimiter>The all-pervading cold torments us all alike.<delimiter>The winter blasts chased you into your dreary dens,<delimiter>And drove us from the fields into our cheerless homes<delimiter>To seek welcome warmth at the blazing stove of clay.<delimiter>You sleep and snore in your wide open winter homes,<delimiter>Without protection from the rigors of the frosts.<delimiter>We, when the northern winds assail us angrily,<delimiter>At once cunningly crawl beneath the windtight roof.<delimiter>There, in seclusion, we hide from the winter’s wrath,<delimiter>And daily warm ourselves with savory hot soup.<delimiter>But you, unlucky things, unceasing wanderers,<delimiter>Be it most hot or cold, bright sunshine or grim rain,<delimiter>Selfsame attire you wear through the entire long year.<delimiter>We, when the sun begins to burn our weary backs,<delimiter>Put on light linen garb, or other lightweight clothes;<delimiter>And when the raging winds whiplash our loins too much,<delimiter>We wear our woolen frocks or e’en our sheepskin coats,<delimiter>Or, to be well warmed up, we climb into our beds.
As I mused all alone, a pack of wolves drew near;<delimiter>Their howls broke savagely into the midnight’s hush.<delimiter>Fie ye, rapacious beasts, do you miss your fresh meat?<delimiter>Doubtless your empty bellies ache and growl at you.<delimiter>Come, come ye lusty winds and lash out at these beasts!<delimiter>Strike them with your sharp darts that paralyze and slay!<delimiter>It is an awful thing how these bloodthirsty brutes,<delimiter>Like gory butchers, kill scores of our sheep and kine.<delimiter>When they attack a herd at a green forest’s edge,<delimiter>They care not if a sow is corpulent or lean;<delimiter>They never hesitate to take a young pig’s life,<delimiter>And have no fear to tear a husky shoat apart.<delimiter>Those slaughterers, e’en when filled up with luscious pork,<delimiter>Are not content, but crave savory veal and beef;<delimiter>They slay the bearing cows as well as barren ones.<delimiter>And still they seek for more. With bloody fangs agape,<delimiter>They kill a gallant bull and a tenacious ox.<delimiter>In fact they slay a horde of oxen ev’ry year.<delimiter>They slaughter oxen white, they slaughter oxen black,<delimiter>They slaughter oxen red, and of every hue;<delimiter>Fearless, unhesitant, they leap upon a herd,<delimiter>And slaughter cows and calves to suit their appetites.<delimiter>They even have no fear of herdsmen and their crews,<delimiter>Who come at them with shouts and cries. These deadly beasts<delimiter>Snatch ewes at the wood’s edge and there they lie and eat.<delimiter>O mighty winter, pray, come forth and punish them!<delimiter>Else all our kine and sheep and swine will be no more.<delimiter>Then these rapacious beasts will maim and kill us, too,<delimiter>And slaughter our sweet wives and our beloved babes.
O ye smart hunters and ye, O learned foresters,<delimiter>Why don’t you shoot the beasts that you are told to shoot?<delimiter>For surely you must know that no fairminded king<delimiter>Forbids you to kill these bloodthirsty animals.<delimiter>Why does the king equip you with a blunderbuss?<delimiter>Why did he build for you those huts in the green woods,<delimiter>And give you leagues of land and miles of pastures wide?<delimiter>Besides, the boors, about to raid the royal wood,<delimiter>Bring you many a ham and cheese, and then with drinks<delimiter>Quench your tormenting thirst till you can see no more!<delimiter>And then, when you are drunk — cannot a finger move,<delimiter>Nor of your solemn oath a single word recall —<delimiter>And as you sway and roll, the mean, conspiring thieves<delimiter>Chop down forbidden linden trees and rare hard wood<delimiter>Or, slaughter sinfully the fast-vanishing elk;<delimiter>And then the scoundrels laugh as they divide the loot.
“Of course, your better nature must well realize,”<delimiter>Spoke Prickus as he passed his old tobacco pouch<delimiter>Around the room and looked at Kubas squintingly,<delimiter>“That ’tis not fitting for the boors to cheat and steal.<delimiter>As commune and the son-in-law of Bleberis,<delimiter>While riding on my rounds, I’ve seen how you behave,<delimiter>So now I wish to say a word about your faults.<delimiter>Many of you report each morning late for work,<delimiter>And then you hardly move after you’re on the job;<delimiter>Some of you just stand there agaping all the while,<delimiter>Tell tales and loiter with your slothful friends;<delimiter>Others keep filling with tobacco your old pipes,<delimiter>Or strike the flint with fire steel over and again.<delimiter>Still others sneak away to loiter, loaf, and steal;<delimiter>Then having ransacked the lunch baskets of your friends,<delimiter>Munch slyly on the stolen food like guilty dogs,<delimiter>And cause your honest fellow-serfs to feel ashamed.
“Well, when a Polish or a Jewish chatterer<delimiter>Maliciously attempts to steal or to defraud,<delimiter>Or e’en a German, telling crafty German lies,<delimiter>Dares to deceive the lords as well as the poor boors,<delimiter>That’s nothing new; for such is their heredity.<delimiter>But what do you think of a stinking simpleton<delimiter>Who, speaking sweet Lithuanian tongue, learns to purloin,<delimiter>And laughs when Krizas swindles Krizas in the game?
“It is astonishing how the good foresters<delimiter>Of late complain about the mischief of the boors.<delimiter>’Tis awful e’en to hear when at the gatherings<delimiter>The ordinary boors, filled up with brandywine,<delimiter>Loudly recount their tricks, misdeeds and rogueries,<delimiter>And of their wrongs and sins make entertaining fun.<delimiter>One rascal brags of how he fooled the forester,<delimiter>Another boasts of how he tricked the forest guard.<delimiter>This one, pot-valiant, raging and staggering,<delimiter>And that one, lying drunk beneath a tavern bench,<delimiter>Both laud the frauds and thefts of the dishonest boors.
“O just and holy God, what fearful times have come!<delimiter>What blindness has obsessed infirm humanity!<delimiter>Another, to please him, loudly belittles God.<delimiter>The lord and his valet are rushing straight for hell.<delimiter>While one, despising God, laughs like an idiot,<delimiter>Another, to please him, loudly belittles God.<delimiter>Beneath a load of woes laments and sighs each day;<delimiter>And such a lout, too, treats the Lord God as a joke!<delimiter>But e’en this foe of God cries that the rich rob him,<delimiter>And that they draw his blood to the last tiny drop;<delimiter>But yet he hastens to an inn for a good fight,<delimiter>And then, come Monday, he keeps picking his snout’s gore.”
“Indeed,” replied Enskys, sitting at Krizas’ side,<delimiter>“Now, Prickus, you condemn the boors more than you should.<delimiter>Pray, why do you denounce our poor Lithuanian boors<delimiter>And disparage them by recounting their misdeeds?<delimiter>You must well realize that boors are all alike.<delimiter>Swede, Russian, Pole and Jew — they all behave the same;<delimiter>The German likewise, who says to the Frenchman ‘oui’,<delimiter>He lies and cheats and steals just as the Frenchman does.<delimiter>You too, my friend, ere you became the chief commune,<delimiter>Drank merrily and deep and lived high with your friends.<delimiter>Many a night you’ve sneaked with us into the woods,<delimiter>And there chopped down and stole oaks, pines and linden trees.<delimiter>Of course, you were a master of the stealing art;<delimiter>That’s why the guards could never catch you in the act.<delimiter>But us, poor fools — and ’tis a shame e’en to admit —<delimiter>So oft the forester has caught and put in jail,<delimiter>That ’tis high time for us to quit the sorry trade.”
Stern Selmas said, “We know no one should cheat or steal,<delimiter>And we Lithuanians should not even think of thefts.<delimiter>You all know that Lithuania is highly praised by all,<delimiter>And how famed visitors from many distant shores<delimiter>Come here to learn about our customs and our lore.<delimiter>Not only Germans come to see and study us,<delimiter>But we are honored with the visits of the French.<delimiter>They learn to speak our tongue, as they enjoy our food,<delimiter>And even wear our clothes as gladly as we do,<delimiter>Though they are averse to wearing checkered garb.
“I think we’d better change our faulty deeds and ways.<delimiter>Yea, let us speak and act as all good people do,<delimiter>So that the strangers may praise us without a blush.<delimiter>We know that God Himself, as He proclaimed His law,<delimiter>Decreed that we shall not be greedy, vile or false,<delimiter>And He permits us not to lie or cheat or steal.<delimiter>When Jonas or Docys steals Mykolas’ jackknife,<delimiter>Or when Jeke by force, or any wrongful means,<delimiter>Deprives Katryne of her broom or cooking pot,<delimiter>Each of the three commits a grave and shameful sin.<delimiter>But what a greater sin it is when evil men<delimiter>Chop down a mighty oak, or a tall verdant pine,<delimiter>Then split the heavy trunk into small kindling wood,<delimiter>And shove it in the stove for heat or cookery!<delimiter>Would not it be as well to use for such an end<delimiter>A bundle of dry twigs, or an old, rotting stump?”
“Look, neighbors, that will do!” cried Prickus scornfully.<delimiter>“Around and round we’ve gone with this talk long enough;<delimiter>Now let us say a word about the winter needs.<delimiter>You all know well that fire, which we gain from a flint,<delimiter>Does great good for us, but quite often does great harm.<delimiter>When you make fire to cook the dumplings or mixed mass,<delimiter>Or sitting by the stove you roast delicious meat,<delimiter>Then from the rigid things you get your tender foods.<delimiter>Indeed, it irks the soul, when weary, worn and wet<delimiter>You creep on your way home; but it is sweet to pat<delimiter>A blazing stove, and then to fall asleep and dream.<delimiter>Pray, is not it a boon from God — this gift of fire?
“Of course, the fire consumes a lot of kindling wood,<delimiter>When we warm up the house or cook a boiling pot.<delimiter>Just think what kind of food we’d have to eat each day,<delimiter>If there were no wood to burn and no helpful fire.<delimiter>We’d have naught but sodden, sour swill to eat, like swine.
“And how would we fare in the frosty winter days,<delimiter>If there were no hot stoves that we could stand beside?<delimiter>Then we like savage beasts would have to roam the fields.<delimiter>That’s why, my fellow-men, each time you cook your soup,<delimiter>Or linger by the stove to gain some pleasant heat,<delimiter>Thank Him for giving you this bright and warming fire.
“And be not vexed if I, as a chief commune should,<delimiter>Now dwell on vital things in just a few more words.<delimiter>The blazing flame of fire that brightens up our homes,<delimiter>When we cook hash or stew makes our old caldrons seethe,<delimiter>And in the winter days keeps our large ovens warm;<delimiter>That fire, hark now my friends, because of carelessness,<delimiter>Most devastating damages can bring to us;<delimiter>As its terrific glare lights up the gloomy heights,<delimiter>It swallows not just our moss-covered boorish homes,<delimiter>But also it consumes the lordly palaces.<delimiter>Our Karaliaucius, too, was twice engulfed by fire;<delimiter>It was because of vice, corruption, filth and sin.<delimiter>And are you not aware how many wretched souls<delimiter>Become mere beggers, when the flames consume their homes?<delimiter>And then, one man by overheating his old stove,<delimiter>Another, broiling chitterlings burn down their homes.<delimiter>And very often, too, some feeble-minded scamp,<delimiter>While smoking a lit pipe, crawls into the dry straw,<delimiter>And, Lord be merciful, burns down the settlement,<delimiter>Down to the very end of the remotest fence.<delimiter>Then such a fool, afflicted by his conscience,<delimiter>Like some tormented soul, unable to find peace,<delimiter>Runs here and there and seeks a place to hide his face.<delimiter>Then you and he are ruined, all you can do is sue.
“My friends you well recall how foul Docys last year<delimiter>Burned down good Krizas’ home and all his earthly wealth.<delimiter>And Krizas is a fine and honorable man;<delimiter>He cherishes his friends and does not harm his foes.<delimiter>Forgetful of himself, he thinks first of his wife,<delimiter>Then of his family, and then about his home.<delimiter>He never drives too hard the men who work for him;<delimiter>When they work faithfully he gives them wholesome food,<delimiter>As well as proper hours for leisure and for sleep.<delimiter>Ah, sweet it is to hear, when Lauras, his hired hand,<delimiter>Lauds Krizas and his home and speaks well of his food.<delimiter>Last year that scamp, Docys, while smoking at midnight<delimiter>In his bed, set his house afire and the fire spread.<delimiter>Before the roosters crowed, the fire lit up the skies,<delimiter>And of good Krizas’ place but one fence pole was left.
“Therefore I beg of you, my neighbors and my friends,<delimiter>In the good Lord’s name, help poor Krizas all you can;<delimiter>When he will bow his head abegging you for alms,<delimiter>Pray, snicker not at him, nor scoff at his worn garb —<delimiter>Nor when he the Lord’s Prayer says, scold or speak ill of him.<delimiter>For the pathetic blow that fell on him that night<delimiter>Might fall on some of us most any day at noon,<delimiter>If we foresake our God, as some bad Germans do,<delimiter>And refrain not from thefts, intrigues and rogueries.
“And so, dear fellow-men, make haste to learn in time<delimiter>How in the winter days you’ll have to get along.<delimiter>For when the blizzards come, you’ll need a heated house —<delimiter>And you’ll not like to sip a cold crumbled bread soup.<delimiter>Many a time you’ll have to make a glowing fire<delimiter>To place your dusky pots within the blazing hearth.<delimiter>So, friends, be on the watch. When you light up your stove,<delimiter>To cook your groats and stew, or bake a cake or bread,<delimiter>Pray, do not harm yourselves or harm your fellow-men.<delimiter>I’ve told you how Docys, that reckless jackanapes,<delimiter>Ruined honest Krizas so that he must beg his bread.<delimiter>So do not fail each day to look into your stove;<delimiter>See that your chimney is devoid of clotted soot,<delimiter>And keep no twigs or chips heaped up on your fireplace,<delimiter>Nor pile on it dry wood or things that can ignite.<delimiter>Henceforth you must observe these salutary rules,<delimiter>Or else the government will hang each one of you<delimiter>Who dares to scorn the word of the just chief commune.<delimiter>Besides ’tis bad when you, having mislaid something,<delimiter>At night with a lit torch you search in dusty nooks,<delimiter>And do not mind your brats as a good father should.”
As Prickus, the commune, thus lectured to the boors,<delimiter>Down in the village street such a loud shot rang out,<delimiter>That e’en the solid ground and all things on it shook,<delimiter>And newly put in window panes began to break.<delimiter>All those who heard that bang were so much terrified,<delimiter>A few faint-hearted souls fell off their wooden seats,<delimiter>While some aggressive ones, posessing better sense,<delimiter>Head over heels all rolled out from Plauciunas’ house,<delimiter>And in the yard they found Durakas all banged up.<delimiter>You see, Docys, being so hungry for crow’s meat,<delimiter>To young Durakas gave a loaded blunderbuss,<delimiter>And told him to shoot down at least a dozen crows.<delimiter>Durakas, a dull boy, obeying his blunt boss,<delimiter>Ran out to kill the needed number of dark birds.<delimiter>Seeing a flabby crow perched high on the thatch roof,<delimiter>He shot so foolishly, he set the barn afire,<delimiter>And soon the village homes were levelled to the ground.<delimiter>Durakas, too, was hurt by the exploding gun.
When this calamity — O Lord save us — took place,<delimiter>At once the squire himself with all his staff appeared,<delimiter>And held an inquiry about the dreadful fire.<delimiter>Here all the witnesses, sighing and shedding tears,<delimiter>Told all about Docys and his abhorrent crows.<delimiter>The chief and all his men, on hearing this grim tale,<delimiter>Roundly condemned Docys and spat disgustedly.<delimiter>But that was not the end: the rogue had to be tried.<delimiter>And so Docys was put in heavy iron chains,<delimiter>Then thrown into a sleigh and hauled to be arraigned.
After five days elapsed the justices convened<delimiter>And many witnesses arrived to testify.<delimiter>Stern Prickus with Enskys and Milkus were on hand;<delimiter>Jeke, Katre, Pime, old Lauras and his wife,<delimiter>And many others, too, appeared against Docys.<delimiter>And when all those concerned were found to be at hand,<delimiter>The jurists ordered that Docys should be brought in,<delimiter>And he made his appearance sighing heavily.<delimiter>The judges questioned him according to the law<delimiter>And fairly tried to fix his innocence or guilt;<delimiter>Too, all the witnesses told nothing but the truth,<delimiter>And their veracity was by the judges praised.<delimiter>But — listen now — Docys just stood with folded arms<delimiter>And angrily replied to questions asked of him.
“What’s that to you,” he cried, “ye kindly justices,<delimiter>Even if I at times, craving for some crow meat,<delimiter>Shoot down a couple of black crows for my own meal?<delimiter>Does not our king permit the shooting of these pests?<delimiter>Among the Lithuanians there are many spoiled boors<delimiter>And many hired hands who strongly down that food;<delimiter>To me ’tis all the same, as long as I eat meat.<delimiter>So why begrudge poor me if I enjoy such grub?<delimiter>Is it not fair enough that I bring you crows’ legs,<delimiter>As ev’ry boor each year must do — e’en though I fail<delimiter>In bringing in sufficient count of sparrows’ legs?<delimiter>And so at least this once be merciful to me,<delimiter>Even if wretched I, to strenghten my poor soul,<delimiter>Each year shoot down for frying some few pesky crows.<delimiter>For ye, O noble lords, exploit us boors so much,<delimiter>That we ere long will have to eat e’en rats and owls.”
Prickus and other chiefs commune, and Bleberis,<delimiter>Were startled hearing such strange charges of Docys.<delimiter>Said one of them, “Indeed, our times are sad and grim;<delimiter>So many wilful rogues oft disobey their lords,<delimiter>And then they harm themselves and hurt their fellow men.<delimiter>Did not our gentle squire, in his paternal way,<delimiter>Give warning not to shoot within the village yards?<delimiter>So many times the priests, during the services,<delimiter>Have scolded us because we disobey our lords.<delimiter>And now you see what ill luck fell to us!<delimiter>Docys, Docys, yo’ve failed to heed our sound advice,<delimiter>When we so many times roundly admonished you.
“It seems, God pity us, that our most gracious lords,<delimiter>Upset by greed for wealth, now skin the boors alive.<delimiter>Too, that Docys shoots down for frying nasty crows,<delimiter>And in a smudgy pipkin seethes their fulsome meat,<delimiter>It is bad news that casts disgrace on a poor boor.<delimiter>Yet how else can the poor their hunger satisfy?<delimiter>Because of poverty, unheard-of things occur.<delimiter>But ’tis, indeed, too bad, when oft a stupid man<delimiter>Shoots rashly and burns down innocent people’s homes.”
Meanwhile the watchman came and bade the chiefs commune<delimiter>To take to Karaliaucius Town the grain for sale.<delimiter>Polite and fat Kurpiuns, the senior chief commune,<delimiter>With cap in hand before the prudish watchman bowed,<delimiter>And said that the command would be at once obeyed.<delimiter>Kurpiuns then called forth all twelve of the chiefs commune<delimiter>And bade them to appear in five days with their teams.<delimiter>They notified the bailiwick of Vyzlaukis,<delimiter>And soon long lines of carts were moving on the road,<delimiter>Like a long stream of ants, increasing o’er and o’er.<delimiter>And it was proper, too; the thralls must serve their liege,<delimiter>And must perform all tasks that are assigned to them.
“Alas,” Lauras spoke up, using well-chosen words,<delimiter>“Into what evil times we’re striding day by day!<delimiter>Now e’en the simpleton that skins the poor man’s back<delimiter>Is not ashamed to boast about his gentleness.<delimiter>Take Kasparas — you know the haughty Kasparas —<delimiter>That dreadful miscreant parades with folded arms,<delimiter>And like a prickly thorn harasses weary boors;<delimiter>And his adviser, Daugkalba, a driveler,<delimiter>Oft screeches like a cockerel and lifts his crest.<delimiter>Alas, few men these days know how to govern men,<delimiter>And while so governing to cherish man and God.”
“You,” Prickus cautioned him, “leave Kasparas alone,<delimiter>And keep still when his forman boxes your lop ears.<delimiter>For though the bellows is so useful at the hearth,<delimiter>It never was found fit to blow against the wind,<delimiter>Nor yet hold off the wrath of an impending storm.<delimiter>Can a mere sparrow match the eagle’s majesty?<delimiter>Or can a frog stand up against the lion’s strength?<delimiter>Therefore beware of jests with haughty noblemen,<delimiter>And hold your flippant tongue from slipping in discourse!”
Then, having said these words before those who were there,<delimiter>Priekus slipped on his sheepskin jacket, inside out,<delimiter>And sped away with other eager chiefs commune<delimiter>To cart to Karaliaucius the squire’s grain for sale.<delimiter>The stingy squire had warned the watchman that he should,<delimiter>With Prickus, keep an eye upon the cash received.<delimiter>You see, the greed of this old squire was so extreme,<delimiter>That if at times he gave a coin to a poor wretch,<delimiter>Because of that he could not sleep for three full nights,<delimiter>And each succeeding morn shed such pathetic tears,<delimiter>That all his maids and help were saddened and upset.<delimiter>His knave, Slapjurgis, and his maid, Susukate,<delimiter>Oft have told why he is afraid of mendicants —<delimiter>It is because he hates to give alms to the poor.<delimiter>Each penny that he gives appears to him as sin,<delimiter>Tormenting him each day and haunting him each night.<delimiter>And even his valet who daily makes his bed,<delimiter>And nightly, when the world is slumbering in peace,<delimiter>With five lit candles guards the squire’s old treasure chest,<delimiter>Avows that oft his liege, before the roosters crow,<delimiter>Jumps out of his soft bed, unnerved and terrified,<delimiter>Because before the roosters crow, a spook appears<delimiter>And drags his treasure chest into his neighbors house.<delimiter>That is why ev’ry morn, when the sun’s rays appear,<delimiter>He falls upon his knees by the uncovered chest,<delimiter>And says “Our Father” for the safety of his wealth.
Now while the chiefs commune with their long line of carts<delimiter>Conveyed to Karaliaucius the grain to be sold,<delimiter>The squire cried ev’ry day and could not rest at night.<delimiter>At times he swore so much that e’en his children cried;<delimiter>At times he prayed so loud that e’en his voice grew hoarse;<delimiter>At times he just moaned low and stared far into space.<delimiter>As thus he sighed and grieved and whimpered dismally,<delimiter>One of his knaves returned from Karaliaucius Town,<delimiter>Bowed low before him, as the servants have to bow,<delimiter>And gave a note from the grain merchant Mikolas.<delimiter>As the squire opened and then read the merchant’s note,<delimiter>Even Prickus, having returned from Karaliaucius,<delimiter>Sighing and worrying, appeared before the squire:<delimiter>Prickus was turning gray and oftentimes fell ill.<delimiter>On seeing three full sacks of gold and silver coins,<delimiter>The squire became composed and ceased to moan and sigh.<delimiter>But when his servants had counted the cash received,<delimiter>What a misfortune! — it was one whole shilling short!<delimiter>Because of this mishap the squire became so mad,<delimiter>That all the long night through he could not fall asleep,<delimiter>And in the morn lashed poor old Prickus’ hide so deep,<delimiter>That after three grim days the wretched creature died.<delimiter>The squire, too, so severely boxed the watchman’s ears,<delimiter>That for five days the man was forced to stay in bed;<delimiter>And each one of the boors that helped to cart the grain<delimiter>Was summarily lashed, because they returned late,<delimiter>And thereby made him suffer deep anxiety.<delimiter>And so you see, dear friends, how grateful some men are!<delimiter>That’s how we are repaid for faithful services.<delimiter>Now almost anyone may harm the downtrod boor,<delimiter>And push him here and there as an unworthy dog.
“Hush,” Selmas spoke, “let’s not despair because of this!<delimiter>Nothing without God’s will can happen in this world.<delimiter>The rich cannot be rich without His providence;<delimiter>The poor cannot be poor without his sanctioning.<delimiter>Therefore each must accept what God has willed for him.<delimiter>He who mounts a high throne as soon as he is born,<delimiter>Must keep in mind that God has given him that seat;<delimiter>And he who at his birth was meant to be a boor<delimiter>Must never be ashamed to wear his worn bast shoes,<delimiter>As long as he performs the work that’s set for him,<delimiter>And all the more — as long as he obeys his God.
“But you, self-willed, gor-bellied, bristling dunderhead,<delimiter>Who like a lightning bolt scare life out of a boor?<delimiter>Were you, too, not begot just as the lowly boor?<delimiter>Did not your mother, just like his, wipe your behind?<delimiter>Who granted you the right to kick the work-worn serf,<delimiter>And then to laugh at him as he succumbs in pain?<delimiter>Though God permitted you to sit on a high throne,<delimiter>And handed you a sword to punish the unjust,<delimiter>He never meant that you should smite the just one, too.<delimiter>Therefore, beware, as you lift up your sharp-edged sword,<delimiter>That you should not cause harm to a submissive wretch.<delimiter>But I observe that you on purpose close your eyes,<delimiter>Because you fear that God knows well your wrongful acts,<delimiter>And realize that soon He will review your sins.<delimiter>Some day He will appear as the Eternal Judge,<delimiter>And having summoned all, rich lords and lowly boors,<delimiter>He will render to each one his own just reward!
“Ye, too, O cheerless poor; ye bast-shod weary souls;<delimiter>Ye faithful feudal serfs, and ye, O shepherds meek —<delimiter>And ye, the other wronged and tortured of this world:<delimiter>Choke back your bitter tears, withhold your moans and sighs!<delimiter>We all recall full well the shock of yesteryear,<delimiter>When, by the will of God, our late beloved squire,<delimiter>By his untimely death, caused us a sea of grief.<delimiter>O kindly squire, why did you have to die last year?<delimiter>Indeed, because we grieved for you and cried so much,<delimiter>O God, many of us became tubercular,<delimiter>And, too, many of us became completely hoarse.<delimiter>So if we now resume again that crying spell,<delimiter>And keep on moaning low and grieving constantly,<delimiter>Ere long we all will turn to be weak, hoarse and blind.<delimiter>Then what would happen if we were unfit to live,<delimiter>Unable to perform our duties to our king?<delimiter>Then he will take our lands and leave us to beg alms.<delimiter>So let’s not clown, e’en though the rulers stretch their crests,<delimiter>And curse each day as they recount the devils’ names.<delimiter>Some day God will judge all, as He has so declared,<delimiter>And then He will reward each one as he deserves.
“Well, that’s enough for us of worrying for now!<delimiter>Let’s take our leave and hurry to our homes.<delimiter>Hark how the womenfolk condemn us bitterly,<delimiter>And how the children screech and scramble in the streets.<delimiter>Our horses and our cows are begging to be fed;<delimiter>Our herds of hungry sows and flocks of starving sheep,<delimiter>And other animals, are crying for their food.<delimiter>Ere long we will feed them; but they must wait awhile;<delimiter>They will receive their share and get their fill today.<delimiter>We know how our dear flocks and herds are to be fed,<delimiter>And know how oft they should be watered ev’ry day.”
Said Lauras, “That’s the way the farmers should comport,<delimiter>If they wish to be smart and to retain their farms.<delimiter>E’en though the Germans hold the Lithuanians as fools,<delimiter>And though the Frenchmen view us with a scornful eye,<delimiter>Yet they enjoy full well our good Lithuanian bread,<delimiter>And smoked sausages they eat, and ask for more.<delimiter>Then having stuffed themselves with lush Lithuanian pork,<delimiter>And having round by round drained out our homemade beer,<delimiter>They’re not a bit ashamed to taunt our decent men.<delimiter>Ye, arrogant Frenchmen, and ye flamboyant Swiss,<delimiter>And all ye who come here to trouble our dear land,<delimiter>What right have you to scorn our upright workingmen?<delimiter>Could not you prosper there whereat you were hatched out,<delimiter>And where you learned to eat your ugly frogs and toads?”
“Now,” Selmas cautioned him, “you’ll hurt the Frenchmen’s pride.<delimiter>You know that ev’ry fool has his own argument.<delimiter>Yes, we Lithuanians, borscht and savory mixed-mass,<delimiter>Cooked tastily with pork, praise highly as we eat;<delimiter>And sausages, prepared in good Lithuanian style,<delimiter>Whenever we have them, we still enjoy full well;<delimiter>Not only we enjoy, but always crave for more.<delimiter>But when a Frenchman, filled with burly frogs and toads,<delimiter>And a Lithuanian, stuffed with mealy peas and pork,<delimiter>Forgets to thank the Lord, as all good Christians should,<delimiter>Then both do not deserve even a crust of bread.
“For even oxen, dun, motely, black, white and brown,<delimiter>Moo pleadingly when they are shown a sheaf of straw;<delimiter>And just as soon as they obtain a goodly wad,<delimiter>Their nimble tongues draw tufts into their hungry mouths;<delimiter>They munch the straw, and gaze at you with thankful eyes.<delimiter>Ah, if these oxen could speak the Lithuanian tongue,<delimiter>For that gift in the barn they would sincerely thank.<delimiter>Of course, in summer time, when hills and dales are green,<delimiter>Each being finds his food in sunlit fields and meads;<delimiter>Each then is on his own; each eats and drinks in joy.<delimiter>But when the autumn winds and winter frosts appear,<delimiter>And ev’ry living thing, scared by the frightful blasts,<delimiter>Draws into his dark hole and thrives on lean reserves,<delimiter>Then there is nothing left to claim, share, or divide;<delimiter>Then each small bit of food is a true gift of God.<delimiter>Indeed, in our brief life we have observed full well<delimiter>How ev’ry living thing in frosty winter days<delimiter>Hides in his hole or nest and thrives on bits of food.<delimiter>For now fish, frogs, and lobsters with their lobsterlings,<delimiter>And ev’ry thing that sleeps beneath the solid ice,<delimiter>And ev’rything that stalks within the forests wide,<delimiter>E’en in the winter time still finds some sustenance;<delimiter>For God is merciful and sees that all are fed,<delimiter>Even though He does not feed them with a full hand.<delimiter>So we, too, must not grieve that our reserves are low,<delimiter>And that the barren fields can offer us no food.
“For ’tis not the first year that we endure hard times,<delimiter>And ’tis not the first time we cook pea and groats mush.<delimiter>Many a stingy spring we have passed in our lives,<delimiter>Many a hungry summer we’ve met on our way.<delimiter>Just ask the hoary men, you beardless nincompoops,<delimiter>And hear the tales of those who suffered oft and much.<delimiter>You are but silly boys and know naught of this world,<delimiter>Yet you, like suckling pigs, just kick and run around.<delimiter>Ere long there will come, too, your sad and painful days<delimiter>When, having thrown away your ponies and your dolls,<delimiter>Of need to earn your bread, will take up gainful work.
“We, aging dusty man, we bent and careworn souls;<delimiter>We, too, once, just like you, skipped in the village streets,<delimiter>And, just like you, enjoyed our happy summer days.<delimiter>And did we expect then, that when the hump’d fall came,<delimiter>We likewise soon would be so worn out and undone?<delimiter>Alas! Too soon too soon the human days wear out.
“Each man, be he a lord or a boor, when begot<delimiter>And painfully delivered, is but a frail sprout;<delimiter>Then having sucked the nutriment that the soul needs,<delimiter>Serenely takes the shape of an evolving bud.<delimiter>Yet not in one day’s time a bud becomes a bloom;<delimiter>It takes some days until the bud casts off its shells<delimiter>And gracefully unfolds its hidden loveliness.<delimiter>But when the tender thing uncovers secret charms,<delimiter>At once the miseries encircle and torment.<delimiter>We all recall full well how we poor creatures fared,<delimiter>When being tiny tots engaged in stupid games.<delimiter>Ah, gone, gone evermore those happy childhood dayst<delimiter>The falls and winters have despoiled their loveliness,<delimiter>And crowned us, aged men, with wreaths of gray despair.<delimiter>Well, brethren, we have passed another weary year,<delimiter>And with it we have passed its miseries and woes.<delimiter>What this incoming year and the ascending sun,<delimiter>If God still keeps us here, will shower upon us,<delimiter>We mortals do not know and thus cannot foretell.
“And e’en the frozen fields, which we this summer plowed,<delimiter>And where we on the run have strewn the golden grain,<delimiter>Now are asleep beneath the blankets of white snow,<delimiter>And do not yet reveal what the benignant God<delimiter>Has prearranged for us long ere we all were born.<delimiter>But we will see that wealth when, by the grace of God,<delimiter>The summer will appear and we will feel its warmth.<delimiter>But that takes time; so we must wait until that time —<delimiter>Until the fields will give us something, let’s not fret.
“Thou, O dear God, our Heavenly Protagonist,<delimiter>Who countless eons ere we mortals learned to think,<delimiter>Excogitated when and where we would be born,<delimiter>And what our needs would be when we would see the light.<delimiter>Thou giveth us our joints and limbs, desires and whims,<delimiter>And prearranged for us all matters of our lives.<delimiter>Thou hast ordained for us the days of grief and joy,<delimiter>And meted to each one his ways and days of life.<delimiter>And now, at last, the shades of the expiring year,<delimiter>And all its miseries that made us ofttimes cry,<delimiter>With Thy kind providence, now are with us no more.
“O ye, frivolous joys of sunny summer days!<delimiter>Ye, flowers of the fields withal alluring charms!<delimiter>And ye, light-hearted birds singing sweet melodies!<delimiter>And all you living things that stayed with us last year,<delimiter>You’ll have no cause to worry when returning here<delimiter>How you will get your food, or where you’ll find a home,<delimiter>Nor will you have to plow the soil or reap the crops,<delimiter>Nor to prepare yourselves for doing feudal tasks,<delimiter>Because God did not mean that you should toil and sweat,<delimiter>For He had promised you a joyful, carefree life.<delimiter>We sinful orphans, we forlorn and wretched souls,<delimiter>We never know the joy of your sweet liberty.<delimiter>In childhood days we met but painful misery,<delimiter>And it will trouble us until we breath no more.<delimiter>As we know, in the year that recently expir’d,<delimiter>Right after Easter we began to plow the fields,<delimiter>And, working through the long and sultry summer days,<delimiter>From our hot faces lots of sweat we wiped away,<delimiter>Until we harvested and stored reserves of food.
“Now since the autumn and the wedding days have passed<delimiter>And we as friendly neighbors had a joyful time,<delimiter>Let’s be more frugal with our lessening reserves;<delimiter>Whenever we cook, bake, or stew some tasty food,<delimiter>Let’s keep in mind the lean days that are bound to come.<delimiter>Because the summertime is still a long way off,<delimiter>When we again will cook fresh foods in our old pots.<delimiter>And so now let us part, and with the help of God<delimiter>Let’s hurry to repair our implements and tools;<delimiter>Because the sun again is thawing the snowdrifts,<delimiter>And once again the lark is chirping on the wing.<delimiter>Yea, yea; the summer dear is nearing day by day,<delimiter>And promises us much of new, good things to eat.
“But without Thy aid, our Father who’rt in heav’n<delimiter>We cannot reap the wealth the summer tenders us.<delimiter>What good are all our tools and our persistent toils,<delimiter>Our new seed baskets and our newly bought plowshares,<delimiter>Our setting out to plow and e’en to seed the soil?<delimiter>All that we undertake or do will come to naught,<delimiter>Unless Thy hand divine doth bless our earnest work.<delimiter>Thou, O God, sustained us in all the years gone by<delimiter>And Thou wilt succur us in all the years to come.<delimiter>What the next summer will give us, we can’t forsee,<delimiter>But Thou already knowest how great our needs will be.<delimiter>For we, with shallow minds, can’t comprehend Thy deeds,<delimiter>And Thy eternal thoughts to us seem bottomless,<delimiter>E’en when at times we dare to take a deeper look.<delimiter>Therefore, O Father, take paternal care of us<delimiter>And all our needs, and when the summertime doth come,<delimiter>Aid us afield, when we again shad toil and sweat.”

Edgar Allan Poe
<h1>The Raven</h1>
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<delimiter>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<delimiter>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<delimiter>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<delimiter>“ ’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<delimiter>Only this and nothing more.”
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<delimiter>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<delimiter>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<delimiter>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<delimiter>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<delimiter>Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<delimiter>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<delimiter>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<delimiter>“ ’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<delimiter>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;<delimiter>This it is and nothing more.”
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<delimiter>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<delimiter>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<delimiter>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<delimiter>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<delimiter>Darkness there and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<delimiter>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<delimiter>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<delimiter>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”<delimiter>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<delimiter>Merely this and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<delimiter>Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<delimiter>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<delimiter>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<delimiter>Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;—<delimiter>’Tis the wind and nothing more.”
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<delimiter>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<delimiter>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,<delimiter>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<delimiter>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<delimiter>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<delimiter>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<delimiter>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<delimiter>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<delimiter>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<delimiter>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<delimiter>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<delimiter>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<delimiter>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<delimiter>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<delimiter>With such name as “Nevermore.”
But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<delimiter>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<delimiter>Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered—<delimiter>Till I scarcely more than muttered: “Other friends have flown before—<delimiter>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<delimiter>Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<delimiter>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,<delimiter>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<delimiter>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<delimiter>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<delimiter>Of ‘Never—nevermore.’ ”
But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<delimiter>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<delimiter>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<delimiter>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<delimiter>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<delimiter>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<delimiter>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<delimiter>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<delimiter>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<delimiter>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er<delimiter>She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<delimiter>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<delimiter>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<delimiter>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<delimiter>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<delimiter>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<delimiter>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<delimiter>Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<delimiter>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<delimiter>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<delimiter>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<delimiter>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<delimiter>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<delimiter>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<delimiter>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<delimiter>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<delimiter>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<delimiter>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<delimiter>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<delimiter>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<delimiter>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<delimiter>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<delimiter>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<delimiter>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<delimiter>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<delimiter>Shall be lifted—nevermore!

<h1>I Say unto Waris Shah</h1>
Today I implore Waris Shah<delimiter>to speak up from his grave<delimiter>and turn over a page of the Book of Love.<delimiter>When a daughter of the fabled Punjab wept<delimiter>he gave tongue to her silent grief.<delimiter>Today a million daughters weep<delimiter>but where is Waris Shah<delimiter>to give voice to their woes?<delimiter>Arise, O friend of the distressed!<delimiter>See the plight of your Punjab.<delimiter>Corpses He strewn in the pastures<delimiter>and the Chenab has turned crimson.<delimiter>Someone has poured poison<delimiter>into the waters of the five rivers<delimiter>and these waters are<delimiter>now irrigating the land with poison.<delimiter>In this fertile land have sprouted<delimiter>Countless poisonous saplings<delimiter>Scarlet-red has turned the horizon<delimiter>and sky high has flown the curse.<delimiter>The poisonous wind,<delimiter>that passes through every forest,<delimiter>has changed the bamboo-shoots into cobras.<delimiter>The cobras mesmerised the gullible people<delimiter>and bit them again and again<delimiter>so in no time<delimiter>the limbs of Punjab turned bluish.<delimiter>the songs vanished from the streets<delimiter>and the thread of the spinning-wheel snapped.<delimiter>The girls fled the trinjan screaming<delimiter>and the resounding whirr of the spinning-wheel stopped.<delimiter>Ludden let go the boats<delimiter>along with the wedding-beds.<delimiter>The swing has snapped<delimiter>along with the strong branch of the tree.
The flute,<delimiter>through which blew the breath of love,<delimiter>got lost in bewilderment.<delimiter>The brothers of Ranjha<delimiter>have forgotten<delimiter>the art of handling this instrument.<delimiter>Blood rained on the earth,<delimiter>it seeped through the graves.<delimiter>The princesses of the valley<delimiter>called Love,<delimiter>now weep in graveyards.
All the villains<delimiter>now move about<delimiter>as thieves of love and beauty.<delimiter>Where shall we seek another Waris Shah?<delimiter>Today I implore Waris Shah<delimiter>to speak up from his grave<delimiter>and turn over a page of the Book of Love.

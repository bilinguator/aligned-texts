<h1>David of Sassoun</h1><delimiter>Translated by Aram Tolegian
<h1>I</h1>
Lion-Mher of fabled glory<delimiter>For forty years at Sassoun reigned;<delimiter>He reigned with might, and in his day<delimiter>No flocks made flight o’er Sassoun’s steeps.<delimiter>Far and away from Sassoun highlands<delimiter>His mighty name was rurnoured wide;<delimiter>His name bespoke his valour, his fearsome deeds—<delimiter>The single name, Lion-Mher.
<h1>II</h1>
Thus, seated like a fearful lion<delimiter>In the Sassoun fastnesses, he had reigned<delimiter>As lord for forty years. For forty years<delimiter>He had never raised a wail of woe;<delimiter>But now, fallen upon declining days,<delimiter>Into that fearless heart there crept a sting.<delimiter>Thus the legened-laden eld to thinking fell;<delimiter>“Alack, the autumn days of my life are come,<delimiter>The black earth soon will claim me for its own,<delimiter>Like smoke will pass the glories of Lion-Mher,<delimiter>Even my name, terror and fear;<delimiter>Alas! On my unowned and orphaned realm<delimiter>There rise a thousand upstart braves and fiends..<delimiter>Upon my passing, Mack, no heir remains<delimiter>To buckle on my sword, protector be to Sassoun.<delimiter>Pondered thus the troubled childless grey-beard.
<h1>III</h1>
Thus on a day, his iron-grey eyebrows knitted,<delimiter>Deep he pondered , when down from the sky,<delimiter>Fronting the giant, stood a fiery angel,<delimiter>His feet enwrapped in billowing clouds.<delimiter>“Greetings! All-powerful giant of Sassoun,<delimiter>Your voice has reached the throne of God,<delimiter>Soon he shall grant to you a child.<delimiter>But hearken well, O lord of the Mountains,<delimiter>On that day, when God grants you an heir,<delimiter>On that selfsame day will you die and your wife.”<delimiter>“His will be done,” spake Lion-Mher, “we are ever<delimiter>Of death and death of us; but if of this world<delimiter>We gain an heir, with him deathless we remain.<delimiter>Here the fiery angel once more took aloft;<delimiter>And onward from that happy day of joyous tidings,<delimiter>When nine months did pass and nine hours more,<delimiter>Lion-Mher a child did have; and David<delimiter>He named his cub, and called to him his brother,<delimiter>Big-Voiced Ohan: bequeathed his lands and scion<delimiter>To him. That day died he and his dame, too.
<h1>IV</h1>
And in those times in Egypt there sat as king<delimiter>Melik of Musr, mighty and unvanquished;<delimiter>When he heard that Lion-Mher no more was,<delimiter>Straight upon Sassoun he marched to fight. Ohan,<delimiter>The Big-Voiced, set a-quake with fear, came before<delimiter>The war-like hosts unhelmeted and bowed,<delimiter>And seeking mercy, fell upon his knees.<delimiter>“O Melik be you the master of our heads,”<delimiter>He said, “while beneath your shadow we live;<delimiter>Ever may we your servants be, our tribute pay,<delimiter>Only lay not waste our tillage and our lands,<delimiter>And with benignant ear hark you to us.<delimiter>“Nay,” roared Melik, “your people all must pass<delimiter>Beneath my sword and homage pay, so that<delimiter>Henceforward whatever I will to do, not one<delimiter>Sassounite may raise a sword against me.<delimiter>Thus Ohan went and brought all Sassounites<delimiter>Together and passed them all beneath the sword<delimiter>David alone, despite whatever moves<delimiter>Were tried, came not near the foeman Melik’s sword.<delimiter>Vexed, the Sassounites came and tugged at him:<delimiter>He bolted once, scattered the throng here and there,<delimiter>The while his little finger grazed a rock<delimiter>And drew from it a flight of fiery bolts.<delimiter>To the wise men gathered all about him,<delimiter>Spoke the King: “I must kill this little fool!”<delimiter>“O King,” they said, “beneath your sword today<delimiter>All Sassoun stands; sure you are the mighty one.<delimiter>What is there a mere child could do against thee,<delimiter>Though he were instead altogether fire?”<delimiter>“You know best,” said the Egyptian king, “but if,<delimiter>On a day some harm should fall upon my head,<delimiter>This day be witness<delimiter>From him will it come.”
<h1>V</h1>
When this event occurred our husky David<delimiter>A mere child was, seven or eight years old,<delimiter>I say a child, but one with so much strength,<delimiter>Man to him or mosquito was the same.<delimiter>But, alas! for the poor orphan on this earth,<delimiter>Though he come forth from the lions of a iion.<delimiter>Now Big-Voiced Ohan had a waspish wife;<delimiter>Once or twice she held her tongue, but one day<delimiter>Thus she began fighting with her helpmeet;<delimiter>“A lonely soul I, heir to a thousand ills,<delimiter>Why have you brought another’s orphan here,<delimiter>Weighed me down with a useless trencherman...<delimiter>Would that I could cast sod upon his head!<delimiter>No handmaid I, dancing attendance upon others!<delimiter>Find a way to lose him, put him to a task,<delimiter>Pack him off that he may labour for himself.”<delimiter>Saying thus, she ‘gan to wail and weep,<delimiter>To mourn her hapless days, to curse her fate,<delimiter>That she luckless was to be on earth,<delimiter>That nor master her did own, nor pitying spouse.<delimiter>Ohan set out and brought back a pair<delimiter>Of iron boots for the child’s feet,<delimiter>Placed an iron staff upon his shoulders,<delimiter>And made him the shepherd of Sassoun-town.
<h1>VI</h1>
The mighty shepherd drove his flock of sheep<delimiter>And mounted Sassoun’s peerless fastnesses<delimiter>“O endearing highlands,<delimiter>Highlands of Sassoun. .<delimiter>When he called, of such force was his voice,<delimiter>That canyons and highlands sounded with it,<delimiter>Wild animals sprang from their lairs, scattered<delimiter>From rock to rock, and became homeless.<delimiter>David went after them all, those from the valleys,<delimiter>And those from the hills—fox, hare, wolf, and deer<delimiter>He gathered and brought and mixed with his flock,<delimiter>And at night drove them all on Sassoun-town.<delimiter>The noise and the din, the sounds and the roars,<delimiter>The charging of numberless beasts let loose,<delimiter>The townspeople suddenly saw and heard.
“Oh! Help! Run.<delimiter>Old and young,<delimiter>Panic-stricken,<delimiter>Away did run<delimiter>From their chores,<delimiter>Some ran home, some to church, some to shops,<delimiter>All bolted doors fast and closed shutters tight.<delimiter>Boldly David strode and stood in the town square—<delimiter>“Well! How early these people are gone to sleep.<delimiter>Ho there! Goat-owners, sheep-owners,<delimiter>Get up, swiftly unbar your doors;<delimiter>He who had one—I’ve brought him ten,<delimiter>He who had ten—I’ve brought him scores.<delimiter>Up, get up swiftly, come and take them,<delimiter>Take your sheep to the barns and your goats.”<delimiter>When David saw that no one stirred, no one<delimiter>A door unbarred, he placed his head upon<delimiter>A stone, lengthened out himself upon the square<delimiter>And soundly slept until the break of dawn.<delimiter>At dawn the nobles arose together<delimiter>And went to Big-Voiced Ohan and said:<delimiter>“Thou Big-Voiced Ohan, be thou taken by Death,<delimiter>You it was who brought this fool, made him herdsman;<delimiter>He parts nor sheep nor wolves, nor foxes,<delimiter>Thus with wild beasts has he filled our town.<delimiter>If lovest thou God, put him to another task,<delimiter>Else he’ll burst the galls of all our townsfolk.”
<h1>VII</h1>
Ohan arose and went to see David.<delimiter>“Uncle Ohan, take care, tread softly,<delimiter>Else the goats will scamper off.” And hard by<delimiter>An ash-coloured hare, its ears fixed rigid,<delimiter>Aff righted became and bolted away.<delimiter>David was up in a trice and after it:<delimiter>In the hills he caught the hare and brought it back<delimiter>And placed it once again among the goats.<delimiter>“Oh, how hard it is, Uncle Ohan. ...<delimiter>God has blessed those black-black goats, but these that be<delimiter>Ash-coloured goats, are ever escaping<delimiter>And ever scattering into the hills.<delimiter>So much did I scurry yesterday,<delimiter>Until I gathered them and brought them back.”<delimiter>Ohan saw that David’s boots were not what<delimiter>They were, his goatherd’s staff worn to the butt,<delimiter>So much in a single day had he run.<delimiter>“David, my soul, I cannot leave thee thus,<delimiter>The ash-coloured goats are torturing you.<delimiter>Tomorrow take the flocks to the pasture,”<delimiter>Ohan said. And the next morning he went<delimiter>And brought still another pair of iron boots<delimiter>For David’s feet, and brought an iron staff<delimiter>A hundred pounds in weight, and made David<delimiter>The pasture-keep of Sassoun-town.
<h1>VIII</h1>
The mighty shepherd drove his herd of cattle<delimiter>And mounted Sassoun’s peerless fastnesses.<delimiter>“O endearing highlands,<delimiter>Highlands of Sassoun,<delimiter>How sweet the slopes rise<delimiter>Against thy rock—ribbed sides…”<delimiter>When David sang, of such force was his voice,<delimiter>That canyons and highlands sounded with it,<delimiter>Wild beasts from their lairs sprang forth and scattered<delimiter>From rock to rock, became homeless. David<delimiter>Fell after them all, those from the valleys,<delimiter>Those from the hills—wolf, leopard, lion, bear, tiger<delimiter>He caught and brought and mixed with his herd,<delimiter>And at night drove them all on Sassoun-town.<delimiter>The noise and the din, the sounds and the roars,<delimiter>The charging of numberless beasts let loose,<delimiter>The townspeople suddenly heard and saw.
“Oh! Help! Run. …<delimiter>Old and young,<delimiter>Panic-stricken,<delimiter>Away did run<delimiter>From their chores,<delimiter>Some ran home, some to church, and some to shops,<delimiter>All bolted doors fast and closed shutters tight.<delimiter>Boldly David strode and in the town square stood. …<delimiter>“Well, how early these people are gone to sleep!<delimiter>Ho there, oxen-owners, cow-owners,<delimiter>Get up, swiftly unbar your doors;<delimiter>He who had one—I’ve brought him ten,<delimiter>He who had ten—I’ve brought him scores.<delimiter>Up, get up swiftly, come and take them,<delimiter>Take your oxen to the barns and your cows.”<delimiter>When David saw that no one stirred, no one<delimiter>The doors unbarred, he placed his head upon<delimiter>A stone, himself lengthened out upon the square,<delimiter>And soundly slept until the break of dawn.<delimiter>At dawn the nobles arose together<delimiter>And went to Ohan, the Big-Voiced, and said:<delimiter>“Big-Voiced brother Ohan, alas, Death take you,<delimiter>You it was who brought this fool, made him herdsman;<delimiter>Our cows and our oxen, unshepherded<delimiter>Let them be, but rid us of this madcap lout.<delimiter>He parts nor bear nor ram nor ox;<delimiter>Some day he’ll bring great harm upon our town,<delimiter>Make it a lair for bears, a forsaken land.”
<h1>IX</h1>
A nuisance David! No peace from the lad!<delimiter>Put to it, and to his wit’s end driven,<delimiter>Ohan fashioned and to David gave<delimiter>Bow and arrows. “Go you forth, hunt among the hills.”<delimiter>From Ohan David took the bow and arrows,<delimiter>Went forth beyond the bounds of Sassoun-town,<delimiter>Huntsman he became. Into a barley field<delimiter>He sallied forth, killing quail, shooting sparrow.<delimiter>And at dusk, he took haven in a hut<delimiter>Cared for by a poor and childless beldam,<delimiter>Betimes to his father known. There, alongside<delimiter>The fire, like an immense dragon and long,<delimiter>He would lengthen himself out and sleep.<delimiter>On a day, when he was from the hunt returned,<delimiter>The beldam raged at him. “Goodness, David!” she said,<delimiter>“Death take you! Are you indeed your father’s son?<delimiter>That field alone and I remain below<delimiter>The skies and God. An old lady, I, weak<delimiter>Of hand and foot—Why do you trample<delimiter>My field under foot, and lay it waste,<delimiter>Cut off my whole year’s living? If you are<delimiter>Huntsman, take up your bow and arrows—bctake<delimiter>You to the headlands of Zudsmaga, all<delimiter>The way to Seghansar—your sire held there<delimiter>Of an entire domain the tenancy;<delimiter>Well-stocked are its highlands with roaming game;<delimiter>There be deer there, mountain-goat and wild sheep.<delimiter>If you can, begone, go seek your game there.”<delimiter>“What is it, you hag, that makes you curse me?<delimiter>Still a stripling I, now only have I heard.<delimiter>Where be then the fastness of our game preserve?”<delimiter>“To your uncle go, Ohan will tell it thee.”
<h1>X</h1>
Next day at sunrise David stood before<delimiter>His uncle’s threshold with bow in hand.<delimiter>“Uncle Ohan, why have you not told me<delimiter>My father owned a mountain game preserve?<delimiter>There be mountain goats there, rams and deer.<delimiter>Up, Uncle, bestir yourself and take me there.”<delimiter>“What!” cried Ohan, “These are not your words.<delimiter>Whoso told them you, may his tongue be tied.<delimiter>That mountain game preserve, my son, is lost<delimiter>To us, as also the game of that range....<delimiter>No more are there mountain goats, rams, deer.<delimiter>In the days when your father was still quick,<delimiter>(O what wondrous days, whence are ye fled?)<delimiter>Oft have I eaten there the flesh of game...<delimiter>Your father died, God forsook us, Egypt’s king<delimiter>Gathered soldiers, came upon us, ruined<delimiter>Our country, and the game from this mountain<delimiter>He took, he plundered: the deer, the hind are gone...<delimiter>Hence our fate’s scroll has thus been written.<delimiter>All is past, my son, go back to your work,<delimiter>The king of Egypt else will hear your voice.”<delimiter>“What can the king of Egypt do to me?<delimiter>What do I ask from the king of Egypt?<delimiter>Let the king of Egypt stay in Egypt.<delimiter>To my father’s highlands what right has he?<delimiter>Up, Uncle, take up your bow and arrows,<delimiter>Your quiver buckle on, to the highlands<delimiter>Let us go, to the mountain game preserve!”<delimiter>Ohan stood up, not knowing what to do.<delimiter>They went, and what a game preserve they saw..<delimiter>The high walls demolished, thick forests felled,<delimiter>The high turrets made level with the earth.
<h1>XI</h1>
Night fell and there they remained fast. Big-Voiced<delimiter>Ohan placed beneath his head the quiver<delimiter>And the bow and peacefully snored. David<delimiter>Was plunged into a sea of reckonings.<delimiter>And soon he saw, in the distant darkness,<delimiter>A strong and flaming fire burning bright.<delimiter>Toward the fire David moved, and held by<delimiter>Its spell, straightway was borne upward upon it;<delimiter>Upward and upward he went, alighted on<delimiter>A rock, ascended again, saw a great<delimiter>Cleft marble stone, from its centre belching forth<delimiter>A pure flame, rising and falling, billow<delimiter>Upon billow, on the selfsame stone.<delimiter>Now David came down from the place, came down<delimiter>And called Big-Voiced Ohan. “Up, Uncle, up<delimiter>And see that bright fire, burning brightly there.<delimiter>How long wiii you sleep! A light has come down<delimiter>From the steep hill, the steep hill of marble stone.<delimiter>Arise, Uncle, from your sweet sleep. What light<delimiter>Be that that issues forth from yon marble stone?”<delimiter>Ohan stood up and made the sign of the cross<delimiter>Against his face. “Alas, my son,” he said,<delimiter>“How I cherish that light! That be the light<delimiter>From our great peak Marouta. In the place<delimiter>Of that light there once did stand our Sassoun’s<delimiter>Patroness (what wondrous days!), Sassoun’s guardian,<delimiter>The blessed Madonna’s monastery<delimiter>Of charghopan. Always, when to war he went,<delimiter>It was there your father made his prayers.<delimiter>Your father died, God was wroth and forsook us,<delimiter>The king of Egypt gathered up soldiers,<delimiter>He marched upon our abbey on that hill,<delimiter>He levelled it, but from the altar still<delimiter>The sacred flames of our patroness rise.
<h1>XII</h1>
When David heard this, too, “Sweet Uncle,” he said,<delimiter>“Uncle sweet, orphan I be and liegeless<delimiter>In this world. Lacking a father, be you<delimiter>To me a father good. I’ll not again<delimiter>From Marouta’s heights come down until<delimiter>Once again our abbey stands as it used.<delimiter>From you I ask five hundred artisans,<delimiter>Five thousand toilers, too, with them to work<delimiter>So that this very week they come and build<delimiter>Our former abbey as it erewhile stood.”<delimiter>Now Ohan went forth and with him brought back<delimiter>Five thousand toilers, five hundred artisans,<delimiter>Who, mid sound and fury, builded again,<delimiter>Much as before with glories overlaid,<delimiter>Our Blessed Mary’s abbey, Marouta.<delimiter>The scattered clergy once again came back,<delimiter>And once again the sound of canticle<delimiter>And prayer re—echoed through the abbey’s walls.<delimiter>When once again his father’s monastery<delimiter>Full-peopled was and merry, David came down,<delimiter>And only then came he, from Marouta’s heights.
<h1>XIII</h1>
This news was taken to Egypt’s Melik.<delimiter>“Well, don’t tell me! So David has rebuilt<delimiter>His father’s abbey and become the ruler,<delimiter>While I have yet the seven years’ tribute to<delimiter>Collect!” Now Melik was exceeding wroth:<delimiter>“Go,” he said, “Patin, Gouzpatin, Sitvin,<delimiter>Charghatin, Sassoun’s earth and stones lay waste.<delimiter>To me bring back my seven years tribute rich.<delimiter>Bring forty virgin girls, nimbus-lit,<delimiter>Forty short women to turn the millstones,<delimiter>And forty tall, to load the camel trains,<delimiter>To be at beck and call my household slaves.”<delimiter>Gouzpatin marshalled up his soldiers true.<delimiter>“Gladly, my Lord,” he said, “so be it.<delimiter>I go to Sassoun even now to lay<delimiter>It bare, to bring back groups of forty women,<delimiter>Forty camel-loads of yellow gold,<delimiter>And ruin the home of the Armenian race.”<delimiter>Thus he spoke. Egyptian maids and women<delimiter>Together danced and raised their voice in song:<delimiter>“Our Gouzpatin has to Sassoun gone...<delimiter>Groups of forty women have I brought,<delimiter>Forty saddle bags of gold,<delimiter>Before my eyes in serried order<delimiter>Have I brought mitch-cows red...<delimiter>In the springtime let us butter churn,<delimiter>O Gouzpatin, brave Gouzpatin,<delimiter>Cast is David in the dust.”<delimiter>Now Gouzpatin, swollen with pride, roaring said,<delimiter>“I thank you sisters all, but patient be<delimiter>Till I return—it’s then that you should dance.”
<h1>XIV</h1>
Thus with a song,<delimiter>With soldiers strong<delimiter>Haughty Gouzpatin entered Sassoun;<delimiter>Straight when Ohan heard this he was tongue-tied:<delimiter>With salt and bread,<delimiter>With cries and tears,<delimiter>He bowed his head<delimiter>Before the spears,<delimiter>For mercy prayed.<delimiter>“Have whatever you wish, so be it; take<delimiter>Rosy-cheeked girls, of Sassoun-town the womenfolk,<delimiter>The yellow gold that’s hard come by, take these,<delimiter>Take these but mercy show our hapless race.<delimiter>Do not cut us down nor do us in to death,<delimiter>Above is God, below are you,” he said.<delimiter>He brought row on row of rosy-cheeked girls<delimiter>And womenfolk of Sassoun—town. Uu stood<delimiter>Gouzpatin and gleaned; he lodged the likelier of them<delimiter>Deep within the hayloft and locked the door.<delimiter>Forty virgin girls beauteously nimbus-lit,<delimiter>Forty short women to turn the millstones,<delimiter>And forty tall, to load the camel-trains,<delimiter>To be household slaves of Egypt’s Melik.<delimiter>And from its hold mound on mound of yellow gold...<delimiter>A pall of mourning hung on the Armenian race.
<h1>XV</h1>
Where are you, O David, you guardian of<delimiter>The Armenian race, O let the rock be rent,<delimiter>Only come you out into the open!<delimiter>Once David had repaired the abbey of<delimiter>His sires, he dropped down from Marouta’s peak,<delimiter>He found a tarnished, helveless blade and stepped<delimiter>Into the grandam’s turnip field. The hag<delimiter>Came forth with cries and curses. “Fool David,”<delimiter>She said, “may you one day eat fire and pain<delimiter>Instead of turnips. in this wide world<delimiter>Do your eyes see only me and what are mine?<delimiter>My field you’ve levelled to the ground, you have,<delimiter>This only had remained my winter’s hoard,<delimiter>This too have you cut off; how shall I live?<delimiter>If you be brave, take your bow, begone,<delimiter>Hold sway over your father’s domains,<delimiter>Eat from the treasures of your father<delimiter>Which you have so long unprotected left<delimiter>That Egypt’s king has sent to pack them off.”
“Why be you so angered with me, grandam?<delimiter>I know not a thing of what you say.<delimiter>What is it that Egypt’s king takes from us?”<delimiter>“The Egyptian king, heavy-footed David,<delimiter>Gouges your very eyes: already is<delimiter>He here. On Sassoun-town have come Patin,<delimiter>Gouzpatin, Sitvin, Charghatin; the whole<delimiter>Of Sassoun-town they plunder even now.<delimiter>Forty saddle-bags of gold for tribute,<delimiter>Forty beauteous virgin girls, nimbus-lit,<delimiter>Forty short women to turn the millstones,<delimiter>Forty tall women to load the camel-trains,<delimiter>All to be slaves to the Egyptian king.”
“O grandam why do you curse me? But show<delimiter>And let me see—these demands, where are they made?”<delimiter>“Death take you David! ‘Where are they made!’<delimiter>Are you really the son of that father.<delimiter>You who are come here to munch on turnips?<delimiter>In your very house Gouzpatin measures<delimiter>Out your gold, while the pretty girls<delimiter>Are together herded in your hayloft.”<delimiter>David left off eating turnips. He went<delimiter>He spied Gouzpatin in his home, counting<delimiter>The gold before him spilled, and Charghatin<delimiter>And Sitvin holding back the barking dogs,<delimiter>While at a distance, his neck to one side bent,<delimiter>His arms folded across his breast, Ohan stood.<delimiter>David saw, and his eyes were gorged with blood.<delimiter>“Stop! Gouzpatin, stand apart. My father’s<delimiter>Gold this be. I’m the one to count it out.”<delimiter>Gouzpatin said: “Well, Big-Voiced Ohan,<delimiter>This seven years’ tribute will you give or not?<delimiter>If not, may my whiskers witness be, I’ll leave<delimiter>And tell Musra-Melik, and he will come,<delimiter>He will lay waste your Sassoun countryside,<delimiter>Burn it down and plant a garden over it.’’
“Begone, you unfeeling Egyptian dogs.<delimiter>Have you yet to hear of Sassoun’s madcap braves?<delimiter>Think you we are dead, or mere shadows all?<delimiter>Think you to place our country under tribute!”<delimiter>David’s wrath was great. At once he clapped<delimiter>The weighing scales, which smashed Gouzpatin’s head,<delimiter>Their fragments flew beyond the walls: till now,<delimiter>To this very day, still are they in flight.<delimiter>Now they rose up, let be the scattered gold,<delimiter>Left far behind the Armenian world and fled..<delimiter>Patin, Gouzpattn, Sitvin, Charghatin.
<h1>XVI</h1>
“Well, well, Uncle, what shall I say to you?<delimiter>We have here mound on mound of gold.<delimiter>Of me a servant of the town you’ve made,<delimiter>Abandoned me before an alien’s door.”<delimiter>“You crazy fool,” his uncle said, “I’ve kept<delimiter>For Melik all this gold that he might kindly<delimiter>Look upon us. Now that you gave it not,<delimiter>Who is there will front his wroth, fight with him,<delimiter>When he comes forth with soldiers and with fire<delimiter>To lay in ruins Sassoun’s earth and stones?”<delimiter>“Stay, Uncle, let him come forth, I shall go,<delimiter>I shall go forth and answer make to him.”<delimiter>He smote the door against the dark hayloft,<delimiter>Let out the pinioned girls and set them free.<delimiter>“Go,” he said, “in freedom live, and fail not<delimiter>To pray long days for David of Sassoun.”
<h1>XVII</h1>
So, battered in this way and bathed in blood,<delimiter>Homeward bound they fled and reached their native land,<delimiter>Patin, Gouzpatin,<delimiter>Sitvin, Charghatin.<delimiter>Egyptian women saw them in the distance,<delimiter>Saw them in the distance and were right glad. ...<delimiter>From the rooftops they clapped and cheered them home.<delimiter>“They come, they come... they bear, they bear...<delimiter>Our Gouzpatin has come from Sassoun-town<delimiter>Brought back groups of forty women, red milch cows,<delimiter>In the spring we’ll butter make and chortaan.”<delimiter>But once they saw<delimiter>At closer range<delimiter>Gouzpatin bloodied,<delimiter>They ceased giggling<delimiter>And wagged aloud:
“Well Gouzpatin, you loud-mouthed runaway,<delimiter>Down what dales and over what mountains have you fled,<delimiter>Your thick head cleft in half? Did you not say,<delimiter>‘To Sassoun I go to fetch groups of forty women,<delimiter>To fetch forty saddle—bags of yellow gold<delimiter>To lay waste the country of the Armenian race?’<delimiter>As a breathless, fleeing hound have you returned!”<delimiter>Gouzpatin, now angered much, began to speak:<delimiter>“Silence, you brats, you’ve seen only your breed<delimiter>Of men and not the madcap Sassoun braves.<delimiter>Sassoun’s madcap braves are mountain-like,<delimiter>Their arrows thick as stakes, and their country<delimiter>Withal a stony fastness: canyon-walls,<delimiter>Impenetrable, abound and deep hollows....<delimiter>Even their blades of grass stand curved as swords.<delimiter>They slaughtered three hundred men, Egypt’s best.”
Thus he spoke and, once he had, he tarried not,<delimiter>But ran fast, head over heels, pell-mell,<delimiter>Ran right up to the king. The king laughed from<delimiter>His throne. “Live, O live, brave Gouzpatin<delimiter>The famed medallion of Ghouzghoun richly<delimiter>You deserve, and from your neck shall it hang.<delimiter>A guerdon for your great triumphal stroke.<delimiter>But where are they? Bring Sassoun’s girls and gold.”<delimiter>Thus Melik spoke: but Gouzpatin had bowed<delimiter>His head clear to the very ground. He said.<delimiter>“Long live, O great king! Barely did I flee<delimiter>Though mounted on my horse. How could I<delimiter>Have borne Sassoun’s yellow gold? A fool is<delimiter>Born among the Armenian race who brooks nor<delimiter>Lord nor fear nor mighty men. See how he’s<delimiter>Had at my bloodied head and smashed it through.<delimiter>‘I will not give,’ he said, ‘my father’s gold.<delimiter>Nor will I give the womenfolk of my<delimiter>Armenian people. In Sassoun-country<delimiter>There is no room for you. Your king,’ he said,<delimiter>‘Let him come, let him come and fight with me.<delimiter>If brave he be, let him come and take by force.~<delimiter>The Egyptian king, enraged, boiled over and over.<delimiter>“Call,” he said, “call all my soldiers together:<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, young greenhorns,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, beardless, without rnoustach’<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, downy-lipped,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, fresh from the couch,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, black-moustachioed,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, grey-haired,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, to sound trumpets,<delimiter>A thousand thousand males, to strike the war-drums,<delimiter>Have them come forth, take up arms, get into mail, —<delimiter>I go to wage war on David, desolate<delimiter>Sassoun-town and plunder it to the ground.”
<h1>XVIII</h1>
Thus he assembled an innumerable<delimiter>Host, marched on the plains of Sassoun and encamped<delimiter>In full solemnity, did the Egyptian king.<delimiter>So great a population did they make,<delimiter>That those who came to Batman’s banks bent down<delimiter>And drank their fill till the river went dry,<delimiter>And Sassoun’s townspeople were parched with thirst<delimiter>Big-Voiced Ohan was taken by surprise.<delimiter>His fur-skin on his shoulders, he scaled the heights,<delimiter>He scaled the heights, and, lo, what a sight he saw:<delimiter>The white tents had so whitened all the plains<delimiter>That one might say mid-winter night had come,<delimiter>And with white snow had covered Sassoun-town.<delimiter>His gall to water turned, his tongue stood tied,
And shouting ‘Halloo’ he rushed hack home.<delimiter>“Halloo, run, it’s come.... Holla, soho, it’s come...”<delimiter>“What, Uncle, what? What has come who has come?”<delimiter>“(Fell fire-and-pain has come to David’s nose.)<delimiter>Egypt’s king has risen and come, come and pitched<delimiter>His tented armies on our plain. The stars<delimiter>May be numbered but not his numberless hosts.<delimiter>Alas, for our lives, alas for our world!<delimiter>Come, let us take the gold, let us take the girls,<delimiter>Let us fall on the ground before him, say prayers,<delimiter>Perchance he may relent, forbear the sword.”<delimiter>“Stay, Uncle, be not afraid; get you to<delimiter>Your restful room and sleep on peacefully.<delimiter>But now I’ll get up, gain the Sassoun plain<delimiter>And make answer to the Egyptian king.”<delimiter>Straight went David to his wonted grandam.<delimiter>“Granny, my soul,” he said, “give me some scraps<delimiter>Of iron, tarnished and old, a grate, a spit<delimiter>Gather whatever you can and give it to me...<delimiter>Also find me an ass on which I may sit...<delimiter>Against the Egyptian hosts I go to war.
“My goodness, David,” she said, “Death take you!<delimiter>Can you indeed be the son of that sire?<delimiter>Your father had in war a fiery steed,<delimiter>Fully caparisoned, with a bellyband of gold:<delimiter>A club of steel, a pearled saddle, helmet<delimiter>Hardy, and a ready cross on his right arm,<delimiter>Mailed vest, and a sword lightning-laden.<delimiter>And now here have you come, O you warped fool,<delimiter>Asking from me an ass and an old spit.”<delimiter>“O granny, not yet have I heard such things.<delimiter>Where is now the armour of my father?”<delimiter>“Go now to your uncle, ask it of him,<delimiter>Say, ‘Where are they? Find, bring them, give to me.’<delimiter>If willingly he gives them not to you,<delimiter>Gouge his eyes, she said “and take them forcibly.”
<h1>XIX</h1>
And David went to see his uncle Ohan.<delimiter>“O Uncle”, he called angered, “for battle<delimiter>My father had a fiery steed fully<delimiter>Caparisoned, with a bellyband of gold:<delimiter>A club of steel, a pearled saddle, helmet<delimiter>Hardy, and a ready cross on his right arm,<delimiter>Mailed vest, and a lightning-laden sword.”<delimiter>“Oh David, my soul,” Ohan roared in fear,<delimiter>“Since from the day of your father’s death<delimiter>I have not brought forth the steed from the barn,<delimiter>Nor from the arms-chest the sword of lightning.<delimiter>The mailed vest, the golden bellyband.<delimiter>For goodness sake, let me be, plague me not,<delimiter>If these you want scamper off and get them.”

David clapped on his armour and his mail,<delimiter>Buckled on, too, the belt of his lightning-sword<delimiter>And, with the cross on his all-conquering arm,<delimiter>Mounted his lion-hearted father’s steed,<delimiter>Mounted his father’s steed and lashed it forth.<delimiter>Weeping, Big-Voiced Ohan sang:<delimiter>“Mercy, a thousand mercies<delimiter>For the steed,<delimiter>Alas, the fiery steed,<delimiter>Mercy, a thousand mercies<delimiter>For the bellyband,<delimiter>Alas, the golden bellyband,<delimiter>Mercy that the rich array is lost,<delimiter>Alas, the rich array is lost.”<delimiter>David flew into a rage,<delimiter>Turned his horse and drove it back;<delimiter>Poor Ohan paled, stood sore afraid,<delimiter>And changed the burden of his song:<delimiter>“Alas, my infant David’s lost,<delimiter>Alas, my David’s lost. .<delimiter>This when David heard,<delimiter>His temper cooled—<delimiter>He dismounted and kissed Ohan’s hand;<delimiter>And Big-Voiced Ohan, as a father should,<delimiter>Blessed him and gave him paternal counsels,<delimiter>And put him on the road to Sassoun plain.

Now David of Sassoun an uncle had—<delimiter>Toros by name—a fearful, giant-like man.<delimiter>When he, too, heard of the rumors of war<delimiter>With an elm-tree on his shoulder, he strode forth.<delimiter>From afar he comes; roaring aloud he cries:<delimiter>“Why are you come upon this field? Who are you,<delimiter>How many heads may there be among you?<delimiter>Have you no knowledge of David of Sassoun,<delimiter>Have you not heard he’s on his way here,<delimiter>And brings his winged horse to pace him around?<delimiter>Clear away, David will be coming here,<delimiter>Wherever he is—I’ve come to make a clearing.<delimiter>As thus he spoke, he brought the elm-tree down<delimiter>From his shoulder and swept off some twenty<delimiter>Pitched tents of the army, the while David stood<delimiter>On a fearsome height and roared a dragon’s roar.<delimiter>“You who are asleep, wake up,<delimiter>You who are awake, get up and stand,<delimiter>You who are afoot, take up arms,<delimiter>You who are armed, saddle your horses,<delimiter>You who are saddled, mount your horses—<delimiter>That you may not later say that while asleep<delimiter>David stole stealthily upon you and left…”<delimiter>Thus he roared, and goading his fiery steed,<delimiter>Came down like a lightning-bolt as from a cloud,<delimiter>Spread terror among the Egyptian armies,<delimiter>On all sides brandishing his lightning-sword.<delimiter>He smashed and slew and slaughtered till high noon,<delimiter>At high noon the blood rose in a floodtide—<delimiter>He rounded up and drove off together<delimiter>Thousands among those quick, among those dead.<delimiter>Among the soldiers was an ancient man,<delimiter>A sage, and one well-travelled in this world;<delimiter>“Men,” he said, “make way for me, make way,<delimiter>I must go to David and with him speak.”
He went to David and stood before him;<delimiter>And this is how the elder spoke to him:<delimiter>“O brave one, may your fist stay ever strong,<delimiter>And in your hand always the stubby sword.<delimiter>“But listen to the words of an old man<delimiter>And see if there be any sense to them.<delimiter>Pray tell, what have these men done unto you<delimiter>That drives you on pell-mell to slaughter them?<delimiter>“Each one among them is a mother’s son,<delimiter>And each one a burning light in his home,<delimiter>Far behind some have left their forlorn wives,<delimiter>Wives whose eyes look on the road for their return,<delimiter>“Some have left a home with many children filled,<delimiter>Some have left behind parents old and poor,<delimiter>And some in tears, with veils across their faces,<delimiter>Are the young brides of only yesterday.<delimiter>“Under sway of sword and by might, their king has<delimiter>Gathered them up and marched them here together.<delimiter>We are men to be pitied, with hastening days,<delimiter>What harm have we brought to you, in what ways?<delimiter>“Your foe’s the warring king, the king himself,<delimiter>If you must fight, go fight with him instead.<delimiter>Pray leave off drawing your lightning—laden sword<delimiter>Spare these people—helpless, unprotected.”
“You speak right well and true, O ancient man.<delimiter>Said David to the eld. “But where is the<delimiter>Warring king? What can he now be doing?<delimiter>Bring him forth that I may wreathe his days in black.”<delimiter>“He has sent out from the great-tent, the one<delimiter>That has the smoke issuing forth from its centre;<delimiter>Yonder smoke is not smoke rising to the sky,<delimiter>It is vapour from the king’s fuming mouth.”<delimiter>Thus they spoke. Now David goaded on his<delimiter>Horse and rode straight to where the great-tent stood.<delimiter>He rode, and rode up to the entrance-door.<delimiter>Thus he roared upon the Arabs standing guard:<delimiter>“Where is he?” he said. “Why has he become scarce?<delimiter>Call him out, into the open call him out;<delimiter>If he knows not death, I have brought him death,<delimiter>If he knows not his nemesis, she am I.”<delimiter>“Melik,” they said, “has fallen asleep.<delimiter>For seven days must he sleep. Three days only<delimiter>Have yet passed, four days more there now<delimiter>Remain ere he will have had his share of sleep.”
“What! Has he brought these poor and pitiful folk,<delimiter>Dumped them on this field, spilled their blood in seas,<delimiter>While he seeks shelter under cover of<delimiter>His great-tent, and sleeps peacefully for seven days!<delimiter>“I cannot abide whether he sleeps or no.<delimiter>Quick! Get him up and out into the open;<delimiter>In such wise I’ll put him to sleep before<delimiter>His entrance-door, he’ll never again awake.”<delimiter>The men arose, crestfallen, then heated<delimiter>An iron rod on the fire; they rapped upon<delimiter>The open heels of the Egyptian king<delimiter>Who was sunk in a deep peaceful sleep.<delimiter>“How now! A body can no longer have<delimiter>A peaceful sleep, the fleas are so noisome....”<delimiter>So the great husky murmured to himself,<delimiter>Turned around and once more fell asleep.<delimiter>They went and with a great plough they returned,<delimiter>In the strong and burning fire they placed its share,<delimiter>And red-hot when it was, reddened and sparkling,<delimiter>Straightway they clapped it on his naked back.<delimiter>“How now! A body can no longer have<delimiter>A peaceful sleep, mosquitoes are so unjust.<delimiter>Slowly the great husky opened his eyes,<delimiter>He wanted so to fall asleep again,<delimiter>But David he saw. Muttering to himself,<delimiter>He lifted his great head from where he slept.<delimiter>A great blast of air he blew, on David,<delimiter>Thinking in this way to set that giant to flight.
And when he saw that David stood stock-still,<delimiter>Surprise and dread struck through his very soul.<delimiter>His menacing, bloodshot eyes he cast sidelong<delimiter>Gloweringly at David’s unblinking eyes.<delimiter>But just as soon as he had looked, he felt<delimiter>From him had ebbed the strength of half-score oxen.<delimiter>So on the place he slept he now sat up,<delimiter>And smiling, thus began to speak with him:<delimiter>“Hello, well-met, David, you are still tired...<delimiter>Come, sit down a bit—let’s talk as is proper,<delimiter>Later we may still engage in combat,<delimiter>That is, if you seek another combat.<delimiter>The scheming tyrant, within his great-tent<delimiter>Had caused a deep pit of forty spans to be dug,<delimiter>Of which the black mouth had been covered over<delimiter>With a screen and, over yet that, some bright throw-rugs.<delimiter>His was ever the habit fawningly to lure<delimiter>Unto him all those he failed to vanquish;<delimiter>He coaxed them to sit within his great-tent,<delimiter>Directly over that black and deadly well.<delimiter>Dismounting from his horse, David came down,<delimiter>He went in, he sat, he fell into the well.<delimiter>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho-ho, ho-ho, hee-hee,<delimiter>Laughed Egypt’s merciless king, the king of Egypt.<delimiter>“There, now let him go and stay in that dark<delimiter>Well till he rots away and then some more.<delimiter>Saying this, he brought an immense millstone,<delimiter>A millstone immense, and rolled it over the well.
<h1>XXII</h1>
On that selfsame night Big-Voiced Ohan slept.<delimiter>He dreamt that there appeared, up in the sky<delimiter>Over Egypt, a bright sun, bright with rays,<delimiter>But over Sassoun’s fastnesses, a black cloud.<delimiter>Ohan was terror-stricken. From his bed<delimiter>He sprang. “O wife,” he said, “bring up a light.<delimiter>Our artless David is in trouble again,<delimiter>“And a black cloud hangs over Sassoun-town.”<delimiter>“May the sod fall on your head!” said his wife.<delimiter>“Who knows how or where David’s having fun...<delimiter>Yet here you are asleep in your cozy home,<delimiter>Seeing dreams and about others worrying.”<delimiter>Ohan fell asleep. Again he started up:<delimiter>“O wife, David is come to narrow straits.<delimiter>So brightly glimmers Egypt’s brilliant star,<delimiter>But sicklied over glows our star and yellow.”<delimiter>“What’s come over you, man, in the middle of<delimiter>The night?” his wife shouted in a fury.<delimiter>Ohan again crossed himself upon the face,<delimiter>Turned around and slept, though with a troubled heart.<delimiter>He saw another dream, more fearful than<delimiter>Before from heaven’s high arch there now sparkled,<delimiter>Full-resplendently, Egypt’s star; Sassoun’s<delimiter>Waning little star sank slowly, toward the dark.<delimiter>He woke up, afraid: “Wife, may your house be wrecked!<delimiter>How could I listen to your witless brains!<delimiter>Alone unto himself our young and orphaned<delimiter>David now is lost. Up! Bring me my arms.
<h1>XXIII</h1>
Ohan arose and went forth to the barn<delimiter>And gave his white horse a pat on the back.<delimiter>“Well, white horse,” he said, “how long will it be<delimiter>Ere you betake me to where David fights?”<delimiter>“By dawn you shall be there,” and saying this,<delimiter>The white horse stooped for him to mount.<delimiter>“Your back be broken! What’ll I do at dawn,<delimiter>View his corpse or his funeral attend?”<delimiter>He gave the red horse a pat on the back.<delimiter>That horse, too, stooped for Ohan to mount.<delimiter>“O red horse,” he said, “how long will it be<delimiter>Ere you betake me to where David fights?”<delimiter>“In one hour you shall be there,” the red horse said,<delimiter>“In one hour I’ll take you where David fights.”<delimiter>“May you burst your gall! Pain and Death take you!<delimiter>Alas for all that barley you have eaten.”<delimiter>And now to the black horse the turn came around;<delimiter>The black horse, too, stooped for him to mount.<delimiter>“O my black little one, how long will it be,’’<delimiter>He said, “ere you take me where David fights?”<delimiter>“If on my back you can stay fast,’’ the black<delimiter>Horse said, “No sooner your one foot’s in the<delimiter>Stirrup and before the other one’s thrown over,<delimiter>I will have brought you where David fights.”
<h1>XXIV</h1>
Swiftly the black horse bore Big-Voiced Ohan:<delimiter>He placed his left foot in the stirrup,<delimiter>By the time he threw his right foot over,<delimiter>The black horse had brought him to the highlands.<delimiter>Now Ohan saw David’s steed, unmounted,<delimiter>A-roaming in the highlands and neigbing aloud;<delimiter>Below, he saw the Egyptian encampment,<delimiter>Undulating endlessly like the sea.<delimiter>And that he might not burst with his straining,<delimiter>Ohan put on the skins of seven oxen.<delimiter>And Ohan stood, like a cloud, atop the<delimiter>Topmost peak in Sassoun’s highlands, and roared.<delimiter>“O David, O David, where can you be!<delimiter>But call to mind the cross on your arm, give<delimiter>The name of Our Blessed Madonna<delimiter>And come you out into the hnad daylight.”
His voice floated, reverberatingly,<delimiter>And into David’s inner ear blared strong.<delimiter>“Ho-ho! That is my uncle’s voice,” he said,<delimiter>“From Sassoun’s fastnesses he calls for me.<delimiter>“O blessed Madonna of Marouta,<delimiter>O intrepid cross of our litany,<delimiter>I call on you—succour David now…<delimiter>He called, and from his place rose to his feet:<delimiter>In such strength, in such wise he smote the millstone,<delimiter>The stone was smashed into a thousand pieces,<delimiter>The pieces upward flew to high heaven,<delimiter>And still to this day are they in flight.<delimiter>Melik, formidable, came out of his lair;<delimiter>By fear his fiendish spirit was possessed.<delimiter>“Brother David, do still come over here,<delimiter>Let us sit at board together and parley…”<delimiter>“Never again at board will I sit with you,<delimiter>You base, you crooked, you poltroonly man;<delimiter>Get up, quick, take up your arms, mount your horse,<delimiter>Come out into the open and let us fight.”<delimiter>“Indeed let’s fight, let us fight,” Melik said,<delimiter>“But mine is the right to strike the first blow.”<delimiter>“Oh very well, it’s yours, strike,” David called.<delimiter>He rode and stopped in the middle of the plain.<delimiter>Musra-Melik arose, came to his feet,<delimiter>He took up his lance and mounted his horse,<delimiter>And dashed off all the way to Diarbekir,<delimiter>And from that place yet again returned.<delimiter>Three thousand boulders was Melik drawing<delimiter>By the handle of his gigantic lance.<delimiter>He charged and struck a blow—at once the dust<delimiter>Arose and the world’s globe trembled strong.<delimiter>“There’s been an earthquake or the world’s destroyed,”<delimiter>Said many people throughout the world;<delimiter>“No,” others said “bloodthirsty giants,<delimiter>Men of might, are having at each other.”<delimiter>“From but this single blow hath David died,”<delimiter>Musra-Melik told his myriad soldiers,<delimiter>But David from beneath a cloud called forth,<delimiter>“Musra-Melik, yet am I among the quick!”
“Well, from short distance only did I charge,<delimiter>But you’ll see now from where it is I come!”<delimiter>Arose the mighty one, came to his feet,<delimiter>And sprang on his mount for a second time.<delimiter>Clear to Aleppo he rode the second time,<delimiter>On his way back from there he left free the reins.<delimiter>Reins came and hail, and a strong hurricane<delimiter>With its tremendous force, shook the whole world.<delimiter>He came, he struck, and from the clamour of<delimiter>The blow, standers-by were fully deafened.<delimiter>“Lost is David to the House of Sassoun,”<delimiter>Announced the haughty Egyptian monarch.<delimiter>“Among the quick am I,” shouted David,<delimiter>“Charge once again — ’tis still your turn.”
“Well! From short distance only did I charge,”<delimiter>Melik shouted, and sprang upon his mount.<delimiter>The third time now that he mounted his horse,<delimiter>Out and away he rode to Egypt’s own soil,<delimiter>And from that distance, the lance in his hand,<delimiter>Back he rode, charging full-tilt on David.<delimiter>He charged on David and struck with all his strength,<delimiter>Struck with a crushing and formidable blow:<delimiter>The dust went up as high as Sassoun’s steeps,<delimiter>So dense it was the sun’s face stood beclouded.<delimiter>For three nights and for three days, the dust lay<delimiter>Like a cloud over all the countryside.<delimiter>For three nights and for three days, the rumours<delimiter>Went forth that David of Sassoun had died.<delimiter>When there had passed three days, like the dust<delimiter>That stood cloudlike, David too did stand;<delimiter>Yea, as the peak, the peak of Mount Kur-Kur<delimiter>Stood David, fog-shrouded, majestic.<delimiter>“O Melik,” he roared, “whose turn is it now?”<delimiter>The proud soul of Melik was terror-stricken:<delimiter>Death’s tremors now possessed his very heart,<delimiter>His haughty, puffed-up spirit was now let down.<delimiter>Melik strode forth and dug himself a deep well,<delimiter>He let himself down into the dark grot,<delimiter>He covered its opening with forty skins,<delimiter>And covered these again with forty millstones.
That lion-hearted son of the lion hearted,<delimiter>David, stood up from where he sat, grumbling,<delimiter>Mounted his stormy steed, made it career,<delimiter>As aloft he held his gleaming Lightning-Sword.<delimiter>There now came forth, her hair loosed before her,<delimiter>The mother of Melik, a mean old crone:<delimiter>“O David, by my hair draw me beneath<delimiter>Your heels, but deal thy very first blow on me.<delimiter>The second time he lifted high his sword,<delimiter>There came running Musra-Melik’s sister:<delimiter>“O David, if it be your wish,” she called,<delimiter>“Strike your second blow on my fainting heart.”<delimiter>Now the hour had come for the final blow;<delimiter>And for the third time David raised his sword.<delimiter>“Now one blow have I left. I must strike for God’s sake,”<delimiter>He said, “I must strike... no one else remains.”<delimiter>Saying thus, he mounted, careered his horse.<delimiter>His fiery steed took flight and sailed high,<delimiter>In the heavens careered, defiantly—<delimiter>Then downward came the lightning-laden sword.<delimiter>Through forty hides of oxen did it pass,<delimiter>Also through forty millstones did it pass,<delimiter>Clear through the loathsome monster did it cleave,<delimiter>Cut into his flesh seven feet deep.<delimiter>“I am among the quick! Strike once again!”<delimiter>Melik roared from deep within the well.<delimiter>David heard, and was much astonished<delimiter>At the blow he’d struck and his Lightning-Sword.
“Melik,” he said, “do move about a bit.”<delimiter>And Melik made a stir within the well.<delimiter>Right down the middle his body split,<delimiter>One section falling here, another there.<delimiter>The Egyptian soldiers, when they viewed that sight,<delimiter>Terror-stricken, their blood to water turned.<delimiter>David called: “Be none of you in fear,<delimiter>But listen yet to what I have to say.<delimiter>“You are but tillers of the soil, farmers,<delimiter>Benighted and denied, hungry, naked,<delimiter>With a thousand and one ills and pains,<delimiter>With a thousand and one troubles to boot;<delimiter>“Why have you taken up the bow and arrow,<delimiter>Spilled over onto far and alien plains?<delimiter>Know you not that we too have homes and hearths,<delimiter>We too have tender babes and the aged?<delimiter>“Have you tired of the quiet and peaceful life,<delimiter>The quiet and peaceful life of the husbandman?<delimiter>Are you tired of the threshing-floor, the field,<delimiter>Tillage and sowing, your harvests and greens?<delimiter>“Return you by the paths that brought you here<delimiter>Return to the native soil of Egypt;<delimiter>But if once again by might and in arms<delimiter>You should dare to march against these freeborn men,<delimiter>“Be the wells you dig forty measures deep,<delimiter>Be they covered up with forty millstones,<delimiter>Against you will rise, just as today,<delimiter>David of Sassoun and his Lightning-Sword.<delimiter>“And at that time, only God will know<delimiter>Who between us shall the sorrier be…<delimiter>We who rise to wage a battle great,<delimiter>Or you, who’ve made of us your enemy.

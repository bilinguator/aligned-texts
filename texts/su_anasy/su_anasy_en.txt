<h1>The Water Maid</h1><delimiter>Translated from Tatar into English by Aydar Shamsutdinov
<i>(Told by a country boy)</i>
<h1>I</h1>
Тhe summer day was hot and sunny, and I was swimming in the lake;<delimiter>A splash of water, games so funny and dives I liked to take.
This merry way I did enjoy my playing for an hour<delimiter>And certain was I not to sweat, moreover short I was of power;
So quickly I ran out of the lake to put my clothes on.<delimiter>But what was wrong? A sence of fear! And all my friends were gone!
To leave the place I was about, but suddenly I saw a bridge.<delimiter>And on the bridge I saw an awful woman. Was she a mermaid or a witch?
In the daylight, broad and clear, golden combs of hers I saw.<delimiter>She was doing her long hair, I had doubts no more.
Breathless, frightened even shocked stood I there not so long;<delimiter>In the shade of old thick trees I felt tremor in my knees.
Having combed her thick long hair, splashing water in the air<delimiter>In the waves she dissapeared. Oh, my Lord, I so feared.
As for me I ran towards the bridge, thoughtless was of course that siege.<delimiter>But how great was my surprise: golden combs of hers beheld my eyes.
What I did — I looked around. Not a single soul was seen.<delimiter>Like a thief I took one from the ground. Oh, of me it was so mean.
Seeing nothing on the way, I was rushing far away.<delimiter>I was burning in the fire, would I get through all that mire?
Time was endless, so I thought, looked around, her I sought.<delimiter>What I saw was awful, scary. I was followed by the fairy.
«Will you stop? Don’t run away! How unlucky is the day!»<delimiter>Shouting she was chasing in a line. «Don’t you know the comb is mine?»
I was trying to escape, she was roaring like an ape.<delimiter>In the field I was alone, being followed by her moan.
Running this way so fast, came the village into view at last.<delimiter>Soon the dogs began to bark, it was such a nice good mark.
«Bow-wow-wow», — the dogs were barking, after her they all were darting,<delimiter>«Now it’s your turn, be afraid, good-for-nothing ugly maid».
So the business being settled, though the creature was too nettled;<delimiter>I achieved my evil goal. Heavens! I was on a roll!
On my coming to my place, rushing home at such a pace,<delimiter>Told my mum I with a burst that enormous was my thirst.
I showed her a comb of gold, tried to look so brave and bold,<delimiter>Words of mine that it was found seemed to her to have no ground.
<h1>II</h1>
Farewell! The sun went down and at once I went to bed.<delimiter>I was lucky not to drown. Thanks to God I wasn’t dead.
While I was upon my pillow, sleep did not befall on me.<delimiter>I heard knocking at the window. Oh, my God, I wished to flee.
Notwithstanding all that noise, I behaved like real boys.<delimiter>But my mum was soon awake, would she know I was a fake?
«Who is there making dogs to bark? Who is walking in the dark?<delimiter>Decent people stay at home, night is not the time to roam!»
«People call me Water Maid and of gold my combs are made.<delimiter>One was stolen by your boy, give it back, it’s not a toy!»
In the sky the moon was bright. I was left by all my might.<delimiter>Trembling I lay in my bed. If I could, I would have fled.
She was knocking all the time. Her concern was very prime.<delimiter>Water dropped from her long hair, was she only my nightmare?
Mother quickly took the comb, threw away it from my home.<delimiter>Prompt she was to lock the door, she wished troubles no more.
When we got rid of the maid, to the Lord she humbly prayed.<delimiter>Then she scolded me in time, stealing things was such a crime.
Since that time I understood, let it be a thing or food,<delimiter>Not to touch and not to take what was left not for my sake.
